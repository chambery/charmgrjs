    detail: "A <i>binding</i> spell creates a magical restraint to hold a creature. The target gets an initial saving throw only if its Hit Dice equal at least one-half your caster level. <p class=sub>You may have as many as six assistants help you with the spell. For each assistant who casts <i>suggestion</i>, your caster level for this casting of <i>binding</i> increases by 1. For each assistant who casts <i>dominate animal</i>, <i>dominate person</i>, or <i>dominate monster</i>, your caster level for this casting of binding increases by a number equal to one-third of that assistant's level, provided that the spell's target is appropriate for a binding spell. Since the assistants' spells are cast simply to improve your caster level for the purpose of the <i>binding</i> spell, saving throws and spell resistance against the assistants' spells are irrelevant. Your caster level determines whether the target gets an initial Will saving throw and how long the binding lasts. All <i>binding</i> spells are dismissible. <p class=sub>Regardless of the version of binding you cast, you can specify triggering conditions that end the spell and release the creature whenever they occur. These triggers can be as simple or elaborate as you desire, but the DM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, or hit points don't qualify. For example, a <i>bound</i> creature can be released when a lawful good creature approaches, but not when a paladin approaches. Once the spell is cast, its triggering conditions cannot be changed. Setting a release condition increases the save DC (assuming a saving throw is allowed) by 2. <p class=sub>If you are casting any of the first three versions of <i>binding</i> (those with limited durations), you may cast additional binding spells to prolong the effect, since the durations overlap. If you do so, the target gets a saving throw at the end of the first spell's duration, even if your caster level was high enough to disallow an initial saving throw. If the creature succeeds on this save, all the <i>binding</i> spells it has received are broken. <p class=sub>The <i>binding</i> spell has six versions. Choose one of the following versions when you cast the spell. <p class=sub><i>Chaining</i>: The subject is confined by restraints that generate an <i>antipathy</i> spell affecting all creatures who approach the subject, except you. The duration is one year per caster level. The subject of this form of <i>binding</i> is confined to the spot it occupied when it received the spell. <p class=sub><i>Slumber</i>: This version causes the subject to become comatose for as long as one year per caster level. The subject does not need to eat or drink while <i>slumbering</i>, nor does it age. This form of <i>binding</i> is more difficult to cast than <i>chaining</i>, making it slightly easier to resist. Reduce the spell's save DC by 1. <p class=sub><i>Bound Slumber</i>: This combination of <i>chaining</i> and <i>slumber</i> lasts for as long as one month per caster level. Reduce the save DC by 2. <p class=sub><i>Hedged Prison</i>: The subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined area (such as a labyrinth) from which it cannot wander by any means. The effect is permanent. Reduce the save DC by 3. <p class=sub><i>Metamorphosis</i>: The subject assumes gaseous form, except for its head or face. It is held harmless in a jar or other container, which may be transparent if you so choose. The creature remains aware of its surroundings and can speak, but it cannot leave the container, attack, or use any of its powers or abilities. The <i>binding</i> is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while metamorphosed, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4. <p class=sub><i>Minimus Containment</i>: The subject is shrunk to a height of 1 inch or even less and held within some gem, jar, or similar object. The <i>binding</i> is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while <i>contained</i>, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4. <p class=sub>You can't dispel a <i>binding</i> spell with <i>dispel magic</i> or a similar effect, though an <i>antimagic field</i> or <i>Mordenkainen's disjunction</i> affects it normally. A <i>bound</i> extraplanar creature cannot be sent back to its home plane due to <i>dismissal</i>, <i>banishment</i>, or a similar effect. <p class=sub><i>Components</i>: The components for a binding spell vary according to the version of the spell, but they always include a continuous chanting utterance read from the scroll or spellbook page containing the spell, somatic gestures, and materials appropriate to the form of binding used. These components can include such items as miniature chains of special metals (silver for lycanthropes, cold iron for demons, and so forth), soporific herbs of the rarest sort (for slumber bindings), a bell jar of the finest crystal, and the like. <p class=sub>In addition to the specially made props suited to the specific type of binding (cost500 gp), the spell requires opals worth atleast 500 gp for each HD of the target and avellum depiction or carved statuette of the subject to be captured.",

If this occurs, you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet so traveled. You can move at only three-quarters speed (because movement on the Ethereal Plane is at half speed, and you spend about half your time there and half your time material.) <p class=sub>Since you spend about half your time on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and even attack ethereal creatures. You interact with ethereal creatures roughly the same way you interact with material ones. For instance, your spells against ethereal creatures are 20% likely to activate just as you go material and be lost. <p class=sub>An ethereal creature is invisible, incorporeal, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down. As an incorporeal creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures. An ethereal creature can see and hear the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and insubstantial. Sight and hearing on the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet. Force effects (such as <i>magic missile</i> and <i>wall of force</i>) and abjurations affect you normally. Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not vice versa. An ethereal creature can't attack material creatures, and spells you cast while ethereal affect only other ethereal things. Certain material creatures or objects have attacks or effects that work on the Ethereal Plane (such as the basilisk and its gaze attack. Treat other ethereal creatures and objects as material.",

The same effect also occurs on the last round of the spell's duration. During the second (and also the next-to-last) round, icy coldness causes pain and damage. In the third, fourth, and fifth rounds, the metal is freezing cold, causing more damage, as shown on the table below. <p class=sub><table><p class=sub><tr class=header><td>Round</td><td>Metal Temperature</td><td>Damage</td></tr> <p class=sub><tr><td>1</td><td>Cold</td><td>None</td></tr> <p class=sub><tr><td>2</td><td>Icy</td><td>1d4 points</td></tr><p class=sub><tr><td>3-5</td><td>Freezing</td><td>2d4 points</td></tr> <p class=sub><tr><td>6</td><td>Icy</td><td>1d4 points</td></tr> <p class=sub><tr><td>7</td><td>Cold</td><td>None</td></tr> <p class=sub></table> <p class=sub>Any heat intense enough to damage the creature negates cold damage from the spell (and vice versa) on a point-for-point basis. For example, if the damage roll from a <i>chill metal</i> spell indicates 5 points of cold damage and the subject plunges through a <i>wall of fire </i>in the same round and takes 8 points of fire damage, it winds up taking no cold damage and only 3 points of fire damage. Underwater, <i>chill metal</i> deals no damage, but ice immediately forms around the affected metal, making it more buoyant. <p class=sub><i>Chill metal</i> counters and dispels <i>heat metal</i>.",

    detail: "Because magic is so powerful, so too is the ability to dispel magic. You can use <i>dispel magic</i> to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, to end ongoing spells (or at least their effects) within an area, or to counter another spellcaster's spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as descriptioned in their summarys, can't be defeated by dispel magic. <i>Dispel magic</i> can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells. <p class=sub><i>Note</i>: The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the <i>dispel magic</i> can take effect. Thus, you can't use <i>dispel magic</i> to repair damage caused by a <i>fireball</i> or to turn a petrified character back to flesh. In these cases, the magic has departed, leaving only burned flesh or perfectly normal stone in its wake. <p class=sub><i>You choose to use <i>dispel magic</i> in one of three ways</i>: a targeted dispel, an area dispel, or a counterspell: <p class=sub><i>Targeted Dispel</i>: One object, creature, or spell is the target of the <i>dispel magic</i> spell. You make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +10) against the spell or against each ongoing spell currently in effect on the object or creature. The DC for this dispel check is 11 + the spell's caster level. <p class=sub>For example, Mialee, at 5th level, targets <i>dispel magic</i> on a drow who is under the effects of <i>haste</i>, <i>mage armor</i>, and <i>bull's strength</i>. All three spells were cast on the drow by a 7th-level Wizard. Mialee makes a dispel check (1d20 + 5 against DC 18) three times, once each for the <i>haste</i>, <i>mage armor</i>, and <i>bull's strength</i> effects. If she succeeds on a particular check, that spell is dispelled (the drow's spell resistance doesn't help him); if she fails, that spell remains in effect. <p class=sub>If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by <i>monster summoning</i>), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature. <p class=sub><i>If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level. If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional interface (such as a <i>bag of holding</i>) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged</i>: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this. <p class=sub>You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself. <p class=sub><i>Area Dispel</i>: When <i>dispel magic</i> is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot radius. <p class=sub>For each creature within the area that is the subject of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against the spell with the highest caster level. If that check fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker spells until you dispel one spell (which discharges the <i>dispel magic</i> spell so far as that target is concerned) or until you fail all your checks. The creature's magic items are not affected. <p class=sub>For each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, you make dispel checks as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by an area dispel. <p class=sub>For each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within the area of the <i>dispel magic</i> spell, you can make a dispel check to dispel the spell. <p class=sub>For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the <i>dispel magic</i> spell, you can make a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area. <p class=sub>If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by <i>monster summoning</i>) is in the area, you can make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel spells targeting the creature or object. <p class=sub>You may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast. <p class=sub><i>Counterspell</i>: When <i>dispel magic</i> is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell (page 170). Unlike a true counterspell, however, <i>dispel magic</i> may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell. ",

You can't actually see through the subject's eyes, so it's not as good as being there yourself, but you still get a good idea of what's going on (the subject is walking through a smelly courtyard, the subject is talking to a guard, the guard looks suspicious, and so forth). <p class=sub>Subjects resist this control, and any subject forced to take actions against its nature receives a new saving throw with a +2 bonus. Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out. Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as you and the subject are on the same plane. You need not see the subject to control it.<p class=sub>If you don't spend at least 1 round concentrating on the spell each day, the subject receives a new saving throw to throw off the domination. <p class=sub><i>Protection from evil</i> or a similar spell can prevent you from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the subject is so warded, but such an effect neither prevents the establishment of dominationnor dispels it.",

A spellcaster on the ground must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose any spell he or she tries to cast.

An earthquake cast on the roof of a very large cavern could also endanger those outside the actual area but below the falling debris. <p class=sub><i>Cliffs</i>: <i>Earthquake</i> causes a cliff to crumble, creating a landslide that travels horizontally as far as it fell vertically. An earthquake cast at the top of a 100-foot cliff would sweep debris 100 feet outward from the base of the cliff. Any creature in the path takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half ) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below). <p class=sub><i>Open Ground</i>: Each creature standing in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or fall down. Fissures open in the earth, and every creature on the ground has a 25% chance to fall into one (Reflex DC 20 to avoid a fissure). At the end of the spell, all fissures grind shut, killing any creatures still trapped within. <p class=sub><i>Structure</i>: Any structure standing on open ground takes 100 points of damage, enough to collapse a typical wooden or masonry building, but not a structure built of stone or reinforced masonry. Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is (See the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i> for information on hit points for walls and the like.) Any creature caught inside a collapsing structure takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half ) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below). <p class=sub><i>River, Lake, or Marsh</i>: Fissures open underneath the water, draining away the water from that area and forming muddy ground. Soggy marsh or swampland becomes quicksand for the duration of the spell, sucking down creatures and structures. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or sink down in the mud and quicksand. At the end of the spell, the rest of the body of water rushes in to replace the drained water, possibly drowning those caught in the mud. <p class=sub><i>Pinned beneath Rubble</i>: Any creature pinned beneath rubble takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while pinned. If a pinned character falls unconscious, he or she must make a DC 15 Constitution check or take 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead.",

    detail: "Casting a <i>gate</i> spell has two effects. First, it creates an interdimensional connection between your plane of existence and a plane you specify, allowing travel between those two planes in either direction. <p class=sub>Second, you may then call a particular individual or kind of being through the gate. The <i>gate</i> itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in diameter (caster's choice), oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into existence (typically vertical and facing you). It is a two-dimensional window looking into the plane you specified when casting the spell, and anyone or anything that moves through is shunted instantly to the other side. <p class=sub>A <i>gate</i> has a front and a back. Creatures moving through the gate from the front are transported to the other plane; creatures moving through it from the back are not. <p class=sub><i>Planar Travel</i>: As a mode of planar travel, a <i>gate</i> spell functions much like a <i>plane shift</i> spell, except that the <i>gate</i> opens precisely at the point you desire (a creation effect). Deities and other beings who rule a planar realm can prevent a <i>gate</i> from opening in their presence or personal demesnes if they so desire. Travelers need not join hands with you&emdash;anyone who chooses to step through the portal is transported. A <i>gate</i> cannot be opened to another point on the same plane; the spell works only for interplanar travel. <p class=sub>You could position a <i>gate</i> in a hallway in order to absorb any attack or force coming at you by shunting it to another plane. Whether the denizens of that plane appreciate this tactic is, of course, another matter. <p class=sub>You may hold the gate open only for a brief time (no more than 1 round per caster level), and you must concentrate on doing so, or else the interplanar connection is severed. <p class=sub><i>Calling Creatures</i>: The second effect of the gate spell is to call an extraplanar creature to your aid (a calling effect). By naming a particular being or kind of being as you cast the spell, you cause the gate to open in the immediate vicinity of the desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling. Deities and unique beings are under no compulsion to come through the gate, although they may choose to do so of their own accord. This use of the spell creates a gate that remains open just long enough to transport the called creatures. This use of the spell has an XP cost (see below). <p class=sub>If you choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known individual&emdash;for instance, a bearded devil or a ghaele eladrin&emdash;you may call either a single creature (of any HD) or several creatures. You can call and control several creatures as long as their HD total does not exceed your caster level. In the case of a single creature, you can control it if its HD do not exceed twice your caster level. A single creature with more HD than twice your caster level can't be controlled. Deities and unique beings cannot be controlled in any event. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making the calling of such creatures rather dangerous. An uncontrolled being may return to its home plane at any time. <p class=sub><i>A controlled creature can be commanded to perform a service for you. Such services fall into two categories</i>: immediate tasks and contractual service. Fighting for you in a single battle or taking any other actions that can be accomplished within 1 round per caster level counts as an immediate task; you need not make any agreement or pay any reward for the creature's help. The creature departs at the end of the spell. <p class=sub>If you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from a called creature, you must offer some fair trade in return for that service. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the promised favor or reward; see the lesser planar ally spell for appropriate rewards. (Some creatures may want their payment in \"livestock\" rather than in coin, which could involve complications.) Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to your vicinity, and you must then and there turn over the promised reward. After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to return to its own plane. <p class=sub>Failure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your being subjected to service by the creature or by its liege and master, at the very least. At worst, the creature or its kin may attack you. <p class=sub><i>Note</i>: When you use a calling spell such as gate to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it becomes a spell of that type. For example, gate is a chaotic and evil spell when you cast it to call a demon. <p class=sub><i>XP Cost</i>: 1,000 XP (only for the calling creatures function).",

Typically, any creature entering the warded area or opening the warded object without speaking a password (which you set when casting the spell) is subject to the magic it stores.

They cannot be set according to class, Hit Dice, or level. Glyphs respond to invisible creatures normally but are not triggered by those who travel past them ethereally. Multiple <i>glyphs</i> cannot be cast on the same area. However, if a cabinet has three drawers, each can be separately warded. <p class=sub>When casting the spell, you weave a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil.

The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. (Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character's perceptions.) Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear. Spells such as bless that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area. <p class=sub><i>See Table 8-5</i>: Attack Roll Modifiers and Table 8-6: Armor Class Modifiers, page 151, for the effects of invisibility on combat. <p class=sub><i>Invisibility</i> can be made permanent (on objects only) with a <i>permanency</i> spell",

You must overcome a creature's spell resistance in order to keep it at bay (as in the third function of <i>protection from evil</i>), but the deflection and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless of enemies' spell resistance. <p class=sub>This spell has an alternative version that you may choose when casting it. A <i>magic circle against evil</i> can be focused inward rather than outward. When focused inward, the spell binds a nongood called creature (such as those called by the <i>lesser planar binding</i>, <i>planar binding</i>, and <i>greater planar binding</i> spells) for a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the <i>magic circle</i>. The creature cannot cross the circle's boundaries. If a creature too large to fit into the spell's area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal <i>protection from evil</i> spell for that creature only. <p class=sub>A <i>magic circle</i> leaves much to be desired as a trap. If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends. The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature has spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle. A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (<i>astral projection</i>, <i>blink</i>, <i>dimension door</i>, <i>etherealness</i>, <i>gate</i>, <i>plane shift</i>, <i>shadow walk</i>, <i>teleport</i>, and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through that means. You can prevent the creature's extradimensional escape by casting a <i>dimensional anchor</i> spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts. If you are successful, the <i>anchor</i> effect lasts as long as the <i>magic circle</i> does. The creature cannot reach across the <i>magic circle</i>, but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can. The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself. <p class=sub>You can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the <i>magic circle</i> more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. The DM makes this check secretly. If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 (see page 65) when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task. This task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20. <p class=sub>A successful diagram allows you to cast a <i>dimensional anchor</i> spell on the <i>magic circle</i> during the round before casting any summoning spell. The <i>anchor</i> holds any called creatures in the <i>magic circle</i> for 24 hours per caster level. A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a <i>magic circle</i> prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram. If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the <i>lesser planar binding</i> spell), the DC increases by 5. The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram&emdash;even a straw laid across it. However, the creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above. <p class=sub>This spell is not cumulative with <i>protection from evil</i> and vice versa",

Then you can attempt to take control of a nearby body, forcing its soul into the <i>magic jar</i>. You may move back to the jar (thereby returning the trapped soul to its body) and attempt to possess another body. The spell ends when you send your soul back to your own body, leaving the receptacle empty. <p class=sub>To cast the spell, the <i>magic jar</i> must be within spell range and you must know where it is, though you do not need line of sight or line of effect to it. When you transfer your soul upon casting, your body is, as near as anyone can tell, dead. <p class=sub>While in the <i>magic jar</i>, you can sense and attack any life force within 10 feet per caster level (and on the same plane of existence). You do need line of effect from the jar to the creatures. You cannot determine the exact creature types or positions of these creatures. In a group of life forces, you can sense a difference of 4 or more Hit Dice between one creature and another and can determine whether a life force is powered by positive or negative energy. (Undead creatures are powered by negative energy. Only sentient undead creatures have, or are, souls.) <p class=sub>For example, if two 10th-level characters are attacking a hill giant (12 HD) and four ogres (4 HD), you could determine that there are three stronger and four weaker life forces within the range, all powered by positive energy. You could choose to take over either a stronger or a weaker creature, but which particular stronger or weaker creature you attempt to possess is determined randomly. <p class=sub>Attempting to possess a body is a full-round action. It is blocked by <i>protection from evil</i> or a similar ward. You possess the body and force the creature's soul into the magic jar unless the subject succeeds on a Will save. Failure to take over the host leaves your life force in the <i>magic jar</i>, and the target automatically succeeds on further saving throws if you attempt to possess its body again. <p class=sub>If you are successful, your life force occupies the host body, and the host's life force is imprisoned in the <i>magic jar</i>. You keep your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, and mental abilities. The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, natural abilities, and automatic abilities. For example, a fish's body breathes water and a troll's body regenerates. A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. You can't choose to activate the body's extraordinary or supernatural abilities. The creature's spells and spell-like abilities do not stay with the body. <p class=sub>As a standard action, you can shift freely from a host to the <i>magic jar</i> if within range, sending the trapped soul back to its body. The spell ends when you shift from the jar to your own body. <p class=sub>If the host body is slain, you return to the <i>magic jar</i>, if within range, and the life force of the host departs (it is dead). If the host body is slain beyond the range of the spell, both you and the host die. Any life force with nowhere to go is treated as slain. If the spell ends while you are in the <i>magic jar</i>, you return to your body (or die if your body is out of range or destroyed). If the spell ends while you are in a host, you return to your body (or die, if it is out of range of your current position), and the soul in the <i>magic jar</i> returns to its body (or dies if it is out of range). Destroying the receptacle ends the spell, and the spell can be dispelled at either the <i>magic jar</i> or at the host's location. ",

The mouth cannot utter verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects.

Of course, <i>magic mouth</i> can be placed upon a tree, rock, or any other object or creature. <p class=sub><i>The spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled according to your command as set in the spell.

Disguises and illusions can fool them. Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical <i>darkness</i> or <i>invisibility</i> does. Silent movement or magical <i>silence</i> defeats audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises (footsteps, metal clanking) or to a specific noise or spoken word (when a pin drops, or when anyone says \"Boo\"). Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. For example, \"Speak when any creature touches the statue\" is an acceptable command if the creature is visible. A <i>magic mouth</i> cannot distinguish alignment, level, Hit Dice, or class except by external garb. <p class=sub>The range limit of a trigger is 15 feet per caster level, so a 6th-level caster can command a <i>magic mouth</i> to respond to triggers as far as 90 feet away.

Regardless, this payment must be made before the creature agrees to perform any services. The bargaining takes at least 1 round, so any actions by the creature begin in the round after it arrives. <p class=sub>A task taking up to 1 minute per caster level requires a payment of 100 gp per HD of the creature called. For a task taking up to 1 hour per caster level, the creature requires a payment of 500 gp per HD. A long-term task, one requiring up to one day per caster level, requires a payment of 1,000 gp per HD. <p class=sub>A nonhazardous task requires only half the indicated payment, while an especially hazardous task might require a greater gift. Few if any creatures will accept a task that seems suicidal (remember, a called creature actually dies when it is killed, unlike a summoned creature). However, if the task is strongly aligned with the creature's ethos, the DM may halve or even waive the payment. For instance, a celestial creature called to battle demons might require a gift of only half the normal value. <p class=sub>At the end of its task, or when the duration bargained for expires, the creature returns to its home plane (after reporting back to you, if appropriate and possible). <p class=sub><i>Note</i>: When you use a calling spell that calls an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type. For example, a <i>lesser planar ally</i> is a fire spell when it calls a fire elemental. <p class=sub><i>XP Cost</i>: 100 XP.",

    detail: "Casting this spell attempts a dangerous act: to lure a creature from another plane to a specifically prepared trap, which must lie within the spell's range. The called creature is held in the trap until it agrees to perform one service in return for its freedom. <p class=sub>To create the trap, you must use a <i>magic circle</i> spell, focused inward. The kind of creature to be bound must be known and stated. If you wish to call a specific individual, you must use that individual's proper name in casting the spell. <p class=sub>The target creature is allowed a Will saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature resists the spell. If the saving throw fails, the creature is immediately drawn to the trap (spell resistance does not keep it from being called). The creature can escape from the trap with by successfully pitting its spell resistance against your caster level check, by dimensional travel, or with a successful Charisma check (DC 15 + 1/2 your caster level + your Cha modifier). It can try each method once per day. If it breaks loose, it can flee or attack you. A <i>dimensional anchor</i> cast on the creature prevents its escape via dimensional travel. You can also employ a calling diagram (see <i>magic circle against evil</i>, page 246) to make the trap more secure. <p class=sub>If the creature does not break free of the trap, you can keep it bound for as long as you dare. You can attempt to compel the creature to perform a service by describing the service and perhaps offering some sort of reward. You make a Charisma check opposed by the creature's Charisma check. The DM assigns your check a bonus of +0 to +6 based on the nature of the service and the reward. If the creature wins the opposed check, it refuses service. New offers, bribes, and the like can be made or the old ones reoffered every 24 hours. This process can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until you decide to get rid of it by means of some other spell. Impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to. If you roll a 1 on the Charisma check, the creature breaks free of the binding and can escape or attack you. Once the requested service is completed, the creature need only so inform you to be instantly sent back whence it came. The creature might later seek revenge. If you assign some open-ended task that the creature cannot complete though its own actions (such as \"Wait here\" or \"Defend this area against attack\"), the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster level, and the creature gains an immediate chance to break free. Note that a clever recipient can subvert some instructions. <p class=sub>When you use a calling spell to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type. For example, <i>lesser planar binding</i> is a water spell when you cast it to call a water elemental.",

It has a Spot modifier equal to your caster level (maximum +15) and is subject to illusions, darkness, fog, and any other factors that would affect your ability to receive visual information about your surroundings. An eye traveling through darkness must find its way by touch. <p class=sub>When you create the eyes, you specify instructions you want them to follow in a command of no more than twenty-five words. Any knowledge you possess is known by the eyes as well, so if you know, for example, what a typical merchant looks like, the eyes do as well. <p class=sub><i>A sample command</i>: \"Surround me at a range of four hundred feet and return if you spot any dangerous creatures.\" The phrase \"Surround me\" directs the eyes to form an equally spaced, horizontal ring at whatever range you indicate, and then move with you. As eyes return or are destroyed, the rest automatically space themselves to compensate. In the case of this sample command, an eye returns only if it spots a creature you would regard as dangerous. A \"peasant\" that is actually a shapechanged dragon wouldn't trigger an eye's return. Ten eyes can form a ring with a radius of 400 feet and between themselves see everything that crosses the ring. <p class=sub><i>Another sample command</i>: \"Spread out and search the town for Arweth. Follow him for three minutes, staying out of sight, and then return.\" The phrase \"Spread out\" directs the eyes to move away from you in all directions. In this case, each eye would separately follow Arweth for three minutes once it spots him. <p class=sub>Other commands that might be useful include having eyes form a line in a certain manner, making them move at random within a certain range, or having them follow a certain type of creature. The DM is the final judge of the suitability of your directions. <p class=sub>In order to report their findings, the eyes must return to your hand. Each replays in your mind all it has seen during its existence. It takes an eye 1 round to replay 1 hour of recorded images. After relaying its findings, an eye disappears. <p class=sub>If an eye ever gets more than 1 mile away from you, it instantly ceases to exist. However, your link with the eye is such that you won't know if the eye was destroyed because it wandered out of range or because of some other event. <p class=sub>The eyes exist for up to 1 hour per caster level or until they return to you. <i>Dispel magic</i> can destroy eyes.

    detail: "This spell combines several elements to create a powerful protection from scrying and direct observation. When casting the spell, you dictate what will and will not be observed in the spell's area. The illusion created must be stated in general terms. Thus, you could specify the illusion of yourself and another character playing chess for the duration of the spell, but you could not have the illusory chess players take a break, make dinner, and then resume their game. You could have a crossroads appear quiet and empty even while an army is actually passing through the area. You could specify that no one be seen (including passing strangers), that your troops be undetected, or even that every fifth person or unit should be visible. Once the conditions are set, they cannot be changed. <p class=sub>Attempts to scry the area automatically detect the image stated by you with no save allowed. Sight and sound are appropriate to the illusion created. A band of people standing in a meadow could be concealed as an empty meadow with birds chirping, for instance. <p class=sub>Direct observation may allow a save (as per a normal illusion), if there is cause to disbelieve what is seen. Certainly onlookers in the area would become suspicious if a marching army disappeared at one point to reappear at another. Even entering the area does not cancel the illusion or necessarily allow a save, assuming that hidden beings take care to stay out of the way of those affected by the illusion.",

You and any creature you touch are then transported along a coiling path of shadowstuff to the edge of the Material Plane where it borders the Plane of Shadow. The effect is largely illusory, but the path is quasi-real. You can take more than one creature along with you (subject to your level limit), but all must be touching each other. <p class=sub>In the region of shadow, you move at a rate of 50 miles per hour, moving normally on the borders of the Plane of Shadow but much more rapidly relative to the Material Plane. Thus, you can use this spell to travel rapidly by stepping onto the Plane of Shadow, moving the desired distance, and then stepping back onto the Material Plane. <p class=sub>Because of the blurring of reality between the Plane of Shadow and the Material Plane, you can't make out descriptions of the terrain or areas you pass over during transit, nor can you predict perfectly where your travel will end. It's impossible to judge distances accurately, making the spell virtually useless for scouting or spying. Furthermore, when the spell effect ends, you are shunted 1d10×100 feet in a random horizontal direction from your desired endpoint. If this would place you within a solid object, you are shunted 1d10×1,000 feet in the same direction. If this would still place you within a solid object, you (and any creatures with you) are shunted to the nearest empty space available, but the strain of this activity renders each creature fatigued (no save). <p class=sub><i>Shadow walk</i> can also be used to travel to other planes that border on the Plane of Shadow, but this usage requires the transit of the Plane of Shadow to arrive at a border with another plane of reality. The transit of the Plane of Shadow requires 1d4 hours. <p class=sub>Any creatures touched by you when shadow walk is cast also make the transition to the borders of the Plane of Shadow. They may opt to follow you, wander off through the plane, or stumble back into the Material Plane (50% chance for either of the latter results if they are lost or abandoned by you). Creatures unwilling to accompany you into the Plane of Shadow receive a Will saving throw, negating the effect if successful.",

The weapon takes the shape of a weapon favored by your deity or a weapon with some spiritual significance or symbolism to you (see below) and has the same threat range and critical multipliers as a real weapon of its form. It strikes the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter on your turn. It uses your base attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round in subsequent rounds) plus your Wisdom modifier as its attack bonus. It strikes as a spell, not as a weapon, so, for example, it can damage creatures that have damage reduction. As a force effect, it can strike incorporeal creatures without the normal miss chance associated with incorporeality. The weapon always strikes from your direction. It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. Your feats (such as Weapon Focus) or combat actions (such as charge) do not affect the weapon. If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the weapon returns to you and hovers. <p class=sub>Each round after the first, you can use a move action to redirect the weapon to a new target. If you do not, the weapon continues to attack the previous round's target. On any round that the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack. Subsequent rounds of attacking that target allow the weapon to make multiple attacks if your base attack bonus would allow it to. Even if the <i>spiritual weapon</i> is a ranged weapon, use the spell's range, not the weapon's normal range increment, and switching targets still is a move action. <p class=sub>A <i>spiritual weapon</i> cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but <i>dispel magic</i>, <i>disintegrate</i>, a <i>sphere of annihilation</i>, or a <i>rod of cancellation</i> affects it. A <i>spiritual weapon</i>'s AC against touch attacks is 12 (10 + size bonus for Tiny object). <p class=sub>If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the <i>spiritual weapon</i> strikes it. If the weapon is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell. <p class=sub>The weapon that you get is often a force replica of your deity's own personal weapon, many of which have individual names. A cleric without a deity gets a weapon based on his alignment. A neutral cleric without a deity can create a <i>spiritual weapon</i> of any alignment, provided he is acting at least generally in accord with that alignment at the time. The weapons associated with each deity or alignment are as follows. <p class=sub><i>Boccob</i>: Quarterstaff, \"Staff of Boccob\" <p class=sub><i>Corellon Larethian</i>: Longsword, \"Sahandrian\" <p class=sub><i>Ehlonna</i>: Longsword, \"Jenevier\" <p class=sub><i>Erythnul</i>: Morningstar, \"Agony\" <p class=sub><i>Fharlanghn</i>: Quarterstaff, \"Traveler's Friend\" <p class=sub><i>Garl Glittergold</i>: Battleaxe, \"Arumdina\" <p class=sub><i>Gruumsh</i>: Spear, \"Bloodspear\" <p class=sub><i>Heironeous</i>: Longsword, \"Justice-bringer\" <p class=sub><i>Hextor</i>: Flail, \"Executioner\" <p class=sub><i>Kord</i>: Greatsword, \"Kelmar\" <p class=sub><i>Moradin</i>: Warhammer, \"Soulhammer\" <p class=sub><i>Nerull</i>: Scythe, \"Lifecutter\" <p class=sub><i>Obad-Hai</i>: Quarterstaff, \"Stormstouch\" <p class=sub><i>Olidammarra</i>: Rapier, \"Swiftstrike\" <p class=sub><i>Pelor</i>: Heavy Mace, \"Sunscepter\" <p class=sub><i>St. Cuthbert</i>: Heavy Mace, \"The Mace of Cuthbert\" <p class=sub><i>Vecna</i>: Dagger, \"Afterthought\" <p class=sub><i>Wee Jas</i>: Dagger, \"Discretion\" <p class=sub><i>Yondalla</i>: Short sword, \"Hornblade\" <p class=sub><i>Chaos</i>: Battleaxe, \"The Blade of Change\" <p class=sub><i>Evil</i>: Light flail, \"The Scourge of Souls\" <p class=sub><i>Good</i>: Warhammer, \"The Hammer of Justice\" <p class=sub><i>Law</i>: Sword, \"The Sword of Truth\"",

Covering or hiding the rune renders the symbol of death ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the symbol of death works normally. <p class=sub><i>As a default, a <i>symbol of death</i> is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select</i>: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune. Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a <i>symbol of death</i> can't trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune). Once the spell is cast, a <i>symbol of death</i>'s triggering conditions cannot be changed. <p class=sub>In this case, &quot;reading&quot; the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning. Throwing a cover over a <i>symbol of death</i> to render it inoperative triggers it if the symbol reacts to touch. You can't use a <i>symbol of death</i> offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered symbol of death remains untriggered if an item bearing the <i>symbol of death</i> is used to touch a creature. Likewise, a <i>symbol of death</i> cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe. <p class=sub>You can also set special triggering limitations of your own. These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. Special conditions for triggering a <i>symbol of death</i> can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, and hit points don't qualify. For example, a <i>symbol of death</i> can be set to activate when a lawful good creature approaches, but not when a paladin approaches. <p class=sub>When scribing a <i>symbol of death</i>, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the effect. Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune's effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune. If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again. <p class=sub>You also can attune any number of creatures to the <i>symbol of death</i>, but doing this can extend the casting time. Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as ten creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour. Attuning a large group (as many as twenty-five creatures) takes 24 hours. Attuning larger groups takes proportionately longer, as the DM sees fit. Any creature attuned to a <i>symbol of death</i> cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when triggered. You are automatically considered attuned to your own symbols of death, and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them. <p class=sub><i>Read magic</i> allows you to identify a <i>symbol of death</i> with a DC 19 Spellcraft check. Of course, if the <i>symbol of death</i> is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol. <p class=sub>A <i>symbol of death</i> can be removed by a successful <i>dispel magic</i> targeted solely on the rune. An <i>erase</i> spell has no effect on a <i>symbol of death</i>. Destruction of the surface where a <i>symbol of death</i> is inscribed destroys the symbol but also triggers it. <p class=sub>Symbol of death can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell. A permanent <i>symbol of death</i> that is disabled or that has affected its maximum number of hit points becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then can be triggered again as normal. <p class=sub><i>Note</i>: Magic traps such as <i>symbol of death</i> are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a <i>symbol of death</i> and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 33 for <i>symbol of death</i>",

Youcan't simply teleport to the warlord's tent if you don't know where that tent is, what it looks like, or what's in it. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible. <p class=sub>To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the Teleport table. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table. <p class=sub><i>Familiarity</i>: &quot;Very familiar&quot; is a place where you have been very often and where you feel at home. &quot;Studied carefully&quot; is a place you know well, either because you can currently see it, you've been there often, or you have used other means (such as scrying) to study the place for at least one hour. &quot;Seen casually&quot; is a place that you have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar. &quot;Viewed once&quot; is a place that you have seen once, possibly using magic. <p class=sub>&quot;False destination&quot; is a place that does not truly exist, such as if you scryed on a enemy's sanctum but instead viewed a <i>false vision</i>, or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you (for instance, a home that has burned to the ground). When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from. <p class=sub><i>On Target</i>: You appear where you want to be. <p class=sub><i>Off Target</i>: You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10×1d10% of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be 15% off target. That's 18 miles, in this case. The DM determines the direction off target randomly, such as by rolling 1d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, and so forth. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and would up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble. <p class=sub><i>Similar Area</i>: You wind up in an area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. A Wizard heading for her home laboratory might wind up in another Wizard's laboratory or in an alchemy supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as in her laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range.

A wall of stone is 1 inch thick per four caster levels and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level. You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. <p class=sub>Unlike a <i>wall of iron</i>, you can create a <i>wall of stone</i> in almost any shape you desire. The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed. This requirement reduces the spell's area by half. Thus, a 20th-level caster can create span with a surface area of ten 5-foot squares. The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing the area. <p class=sub>Like any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a <i>disintegrate</i> spell or by normal means such as breaking and chipping. Each 5-foot square of the wall has 15 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 8. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 20 + 2 per inch of thickness. <p class=sub>It is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within or under a <i>wall of stone</i>, provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures. Creatures can avoid entrapment with successful Reflex saves",

Any creature forced into or attempting to move through a wall of thorns takes slashing damage per round of movement equal to 25 minus the creature's AC. Dexterity and dodge bonuses to AC do not count for this calculation. (Creatures with an Armor Class of 25 or higher, without considering Dexterity and dodge bonuses, take no damage from contact with the wall.) <p class=sub>You can make the wall as thin as 5 feet thick, which allows you to shape the wall as a number of 10-by-10-by-5-foot blocks equal to twice your caster level. This has no effect on the damage dealt by the thorns, but any creature attempting to break through takes that much less time to force its way through the barrier.<p class=sub>Creatures can force their way slowly through the wall by making a Strength check as a full-round action. For every 5 points by which the check exceeds 20, a creature moves 5 feet (up to a maximum distance equal to its normal land speed). For example, a creature that rolled 25 on its Strength check could move 5 feet in a round. Of course, moving or attempting to move through the thorns incurs damage as described above. A creature trapped in the thorns can choose to remain motionless in order to avoid taking any more damage. <p class=sub>Any creature within the area of the spell when it is cast takes damage as if it had moved into the wall and is caught inside. In order to escape, it must attempt to push its way free, or it can wait until the spell ends. Creatures with the ability to pass through overgrown areas unhindered can pass through a wall of thorns at normal speed without taking damage. <p class=sub>A <i>wall of thorns</i> can be breached by slow work with edged weapons. Chopping away at the wall creates a safe passage 1 foot deep for every 10 minutes of work. Normal fire cannot harm the barrier, but magical fire burns it away in 10 minutes. <p class=sub>Despite its appearance, a <i>wall of thorns</i> is not actually a living plant, and thus is unaffected by spells that affect plants.",

You must designate the sanctuary when you prepare the spell, and it must be a very familiar place. The actual point of arrival is a designated area no larger than 10 feet by 10 feet. You can be transported any distance within a plane but cannot travel between planes. You can transport, in addition to yourself, any objects you carry, as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. Exceeding this limit causes the spell to fail. <p class=sub>An unwilling creature can't be teleported by <i>word of recall</i>. Likewise, a creature's Will save (or spell resistance) prevents items in its possession from being teleported. Unattended, nonmagical objects receive no saving throw.",
