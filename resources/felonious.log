Exhausted, he could not sleep. He lay staring up through closed eyes, seeing the horde advance through the valley. Soldiers, children, priests, Kani and Kar-Kani, woodland creatures–anything once living–all stumbling and running, all tearing and biting, all unfeeling, unstoppable. The memory from Soulforge of clerics, praying to the empty sky, their gods deaf to centuries of tradition and devotion, torn down where they stood. The Holy City a smoking ruin desecrated to its foundation. His stone bed shivered imperceptibly from the seige weapons rolling out to the valley battlements, but he could not hear the creaks and clangs and shouts of Rockholm as the city prepared itself for invasion throughout the night. In his silent dark room, he saw with the clarity of daylight the futility of standing against this army of darkness.

A horn blast the call to arms before dawn. Felonious dressed, slipping quickly into light leather armor and a cloak that enveloped him like shadow. He ran to meet his comrades, passing old and young dwarves standing in orderly lines in every street and alley, slowly making their way to the mountain evacuation. The city had not been evacuated in many long centuries, but it was executed with a practiced competence. He ran through the high market, past boarded up storefronts and taverns, all commerce stopped save for the cathedral. Rhythmic prayers echoing from the open doors provided an underscore to the preparations for war and evacuation. In the days since his group's arrival, the priests of Moradin spent every hour in continuous devotion, reciting with a reverent desperation the ancient poetry of the liturgy. On this morning, the intonations were quieter and slower, more measured. With the Hammer of Moradin deployed to the front, only the elder priests and acolytes remained in vigil.

"State your business", a guard shouted as he approached the city gates. His partner casually leveled his crossbow at Felonious.

"Felonious of [], attached to Rolf []"

"Noone in or out without orders!", the guarded shouted again. The Mask of the Triad made him appear authentically Dwarven, but his gait and the way he flattened the r's of Rolf's name, betrayed him as a foreigner. In the pre-dawn darkness, his form was indistinct in the flickering torchlight.

"I am here from [] at the behest of the king." Felonious pulled out the medallion with the king's seal. 

"You may pass. Moradin be with you.", said the guard, but without the force the soldier's blessing demanded. They watched him curiously as he ran through the gates and out onto the stone road that led to the frontline in the valley.

A huge cart laden with catapult shot the size of a full-grown dwarf slowed him as he raced down the winding mountain road. He paused behind the massive wheels crunching over pebbles and glanced back to the city walls rising out of the sheer cliff face. Even more impressive from this angle, its perfection seemed supernaturally formed from the mountain itself. If whole of Hell itself laid siege to this edifice, the wall would not fail, he thought. "I hope," he said aloud.

He found Seth and the priests at the first ballista station above the valley. The gorge was a steeply-walled narrow box canyon with a single road connecting the mountain road at the back. Permanent fortifications were placed on the four "corners" of the canyon.

"The scouts report the enemy is a little more than a mile off and advancing quickly. They are all of the Dead." He spat. "The dwarves have sent out a sent a party of skirmishers to delay them. Reports suggest they are not effective." He added, "The furthest ranging cannot find the end of them." Rolf began shouting orders as the dwarves were organizing battle lines, and Seth and two priests left to find their way into formation. The priests from the temple, the Hammer of Moradin, were engaged in their own clerical preparations [did scar and the others do their]

He noticed a crow flying towards them, as he aided the siege engineers with the ballista. Instead of veering off, it landed on his shoulder. He made no attempt to shoo it,

"Crow, why do you come?" He spoke to the bird with a kind of animal telepathy.

The bird cawed and ruffled its wings, but Felonious understood it clearly: "Felonious," he heard the voice of his old master. "This battle is folly. I have seen the foul legion on my journey, and it cannot be overcome, not by mortal means. These brave people will only fall and swell the ranks of undead further.

You must warn the commander that his men are needed to join with the humans and elves. Only the combined might of races can hope to defeat this enemy."

"We've tried, but these people, they do not know the Triad. The pray still to Moradin, even though their prayers go unanswered. They are as stubborn."

The crow sorted its wing feathers. "You have not failed. If they will not heed your counsel–you were never to be a diplomat–you must stay and aid the evacuation as you are able. I see Mithrandir's bow has found you. It has waited many years for a worthy hand. I must go." With these words, the crow leapt into flight, heading east.

Felonious found [] conferring with another commander over papers in a makeshift tent on the canyon floor.

"[]!" Felonious shouted above the preparations. [] ignored him. "I have news from [] of the Counsel. He has seen the force you are preparing to fight. They are too many. You must make immediate plans to retreat."

[] turned his face to F with a look of fierce disgust. "You are a fool." he said, returning to his papers.

His compatriots, thrilled by the thought of battle, were not receptive. He climbed back to his station on the forward fortification on the canyon cliffs.

––

The eastern sky glowed pink as the dawn light filtered through a dust cloud on the horizon. Thousands of Kani and Kar-kani lumbered toward the Dwarven line like a frightened herd of sickly cattle. Sightless but intent, trampling the fallen, a legion of pale undead making no sound but the low rumble of thousand of footfalls.

"The fuck–"


Hundreds of crossbow bolts thudded home. Some hit and stuck their target, knocking a Kani down, only to have the creature crawl back to its feet and stumble forward with the quarrel still sticking out where it landed. Others ripped through flesh, leaving a ragged, bloodless hole and the victim staggered, but undeterred. Volley after volley launched, transforming the first wave of Kani into a horrifying pincushion of bolts.

Boulders launched into the horde. Dozens were destroyed on impact, ten times that mangled and broken as the massive rocks tore through the ranks of undead. A cheer went up from the Dwarven lines as the first volley landed, shaking the earth and sending bodies flying. But cheers quieted as
