You know we lammasu are trustworthy, so you can believe me.&#39;</td><td></td></tr></table><p class=sub>Favorable and unfavorable circumstances weigh heavily on the outcome of a bluff. Two circumstances can weigh against you: The bluff is hard to believe, or the action that the target is asked to take goes against its self-interest, nature, persona- lity, orders, or the like. If it&#39;s important, the DM can distinguish between a bluff that fails because the target doesn&#39;t believe it and one that fails because it just asks too much of the target. For instance, if the target gets a +10 bonus on its Sense Motive check because the bluff demands something risky, and the Sense Motive check succeeds by 10 or less, then the target didn&#39;t so much see through the bluff as prove reluctant to go along with it. A target that succeeds by 11 or more has seen through the bluff (and would have done so even if that bluff had not entailed any demand). <p class=sub>A successful Bluff check indicates that the target reacts as you wish, at least for a short time (usually 1 round or less) or believes something that you want it to believe. Bluff, however, is not a suggestion spell. For example, you could use bluff to put a shopkeeper off guard by saying that his shoes are untied. At best, such a bluff would make the shopkeeper glance down at his shoes. It would not cause him to ignore you and fiddle with his shoes. <p class=sub>A bluff requires interaction between you and the target. Creatures unaware of you cannot be bluffed. <p class=sub><i>Feinting in Combat</i>: You can also use Bluff to mislead an opponent in melee combat (so that it can&#39;t dodge your next attack effectively). To feint, make a Bluff check opposed by your target&#39;s Sense Motive check, but in this case, the target may add its base attack bonus to the roll along with any other applicable modifiers. If your Bluff check result exceeds this special Sense Motive check result, your target is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) for the next melee attack you make against it. This attack must be made on or before your next turn. <p class=sub>Feinting in this way against a nonhumanoid is difficult because it&#39;s harder to read a strange creature&#39;s body language; you take a -4 penalty on your Bluff check. Against a creature of animal Intelligence (1 or 2) it&#39;s even harder; you take a -8 penalty. Against a non- ntelligent creature, it&#39;s impossible. <p class=sub>Feinting in combat does not provoke an attack of opportunity. <p class=sub><i>Creating a Diversion to Hide</i>: You can use the Bluff skill to help you hide. A successful Bluff check gives you the momentary diversion you need to attempt a Hide check while people are aware of you. This usage does not provoke an attack of opportunity. <p class=sub><i>Delivering a Secret Message</i>: You can use Bluff to get a message across to another character without others understanding it. Two rogues, for example, might seem to be talking about bakery goods when they&#39;re really planning how to break into the evil wizard&#39;s laboratory. The DC is 15 for simple messages, or 20 for complex messages, especially those that rely on getting across new information. Failure by 4 or less means you can&#39;t get the message across. Failure by 5 or more means that some false information has been implied or inferred. Anyone listening to the exchange can make a Sense Motive check opposed by the Bluff check you made to transmit in order to intercept your message (see Sense Motive, page 81). <p class=sub><b>Action</b>: Varies. A Bluff check made as part of general interaction always takes at least 1 round (and is at least a full-round action), but it can take much longer if you try something elaborate. A Bluff check made to feint in combat or create a diversion to hide is a standard action. A Bluff check made to deliver a secret message doesn&#39;t take an action; it is part of normal communication. However, the DM may limit the amount of information you can convey in a single round. <p class=sub><b>Try Again</b>: Varies. Generally, a failed Bluff check in social interaction makes the target too suspicious for you to try again in the same circumstances, but you may retry freely on Bluff checks made to feint in combat. Retries are also allowed when you are trying to send a message, but you may attempt such a retry only once per round. Each retry carries the same chance of miscommunication. <p class=sub><b>Special</b>: A ranger gains a bonus on Bluff checks when using this skill against a favored enemy (see page 47). The master of a snake familiar (see the Familiars sidebar, page 52) gains a +3 bonus on Bluff checks. If you have the Persuasive feat, you get a +2 bonus on Bluff checks. <p class=sub><b>Synergy</b>: If you have 5 or more ranks in Bluff, you get a +2 bonus on Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sleight of Hand checks, as well as on Disguise checks made when you know you&#39;re being observed and you try to act in character.", type: "skill", tags: ["phb"]

A slope is considered to be any incline at an angle measuring less than 60 degrees; a wall is any incline at an angle measuring 60 degrees or more. <p class=sub>A Climb check that fails by 4 or less means that you make no progress, and one that fails by 5 or more means that you fall from whatever height you have already attained. <p class=sub>A climber&#39;s kit (page 130) gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Climb checks. <p class=sub>The DC of the check depends on the conditions of the climb.

While climbing, you can&#39;t move to avoid a blow, so you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC (if any). You also can&#39;t use a shield while climbing. <p class=sub>Any time you take damage while climbing, make a Climb check against the DC of the slope or wall. Failure means you fall from your curreint height and sustain the appropriate falling damage. (The <i>Dungeon Master&#39;s Guide</i> has information on falling damage.) <p class=sub><i>Accelerated Climbing</i>: You try to climb more quickly than normal. By accepting a -5 penalty, you can move half your speed (instead of one-quarter your speed). <p class=sub><i>Making Your Own Handholds and Footholds</i>: You can make your own handholds and footholds by pounding pitons into a wall. Doing so takes 1 minute per piton, and one piton is needed per 3 feet of distance. As with any surface that offers handholds and footholds, a wall with pitons in it has a DC of 15. In the same way, a climber with a handaxe or similar implement can cut handholds in an ice wall. <p class=sub><i>Catching Yourself When Falling</i>: It&#39;s practically impossible to catch yourself on a wall while falling. Make a Climb check (DC = wall&#39;s DC + 20) to do so. It&#39;s much easier to catch yourself on a slope (DC = slope&#39;s DC + 10). <p class=sub><i>Catching a Falling Character While Climbing</i>: If someone climbing above you or adjacent to you falls, you can attempt to catch the falling character if he or she is within your reach. Doing so requires a successful melee touch attack against the falling character (though he or she can voluntarily forego any Dexterity bonus to AC if desired). If you hit, you must immediately attempt a Climb check (DC = wall&#39;s DC + 10). Success indicates that you catch the falling character, but his or her total weight, including equipment, cannot exceed your heavy load limit or you automatically fall. If you fail your Climb check by 4 or less, you fail to stop the character&#39;s fall but don&#39;t lose your grip on the wall. If you fail by 5 or more, you fail to stop the character&#39;s fall and begin falling as well. <p class=sub><b>Action</b>: Climbing is part of movement, so it&#39;s generally part of a move action (and may be combined with other types of movement in a move action). Each move action that includes any climbing requires a separate Climb check. Catching yourself or another falling character doesn&#39;t take an action. <p class=sub><b>Special</b>: You can use a rope to haul a character upward (or lower a character) through sheer strength. You can lift double your maximum load in this manner. <p class=sub>A halfling has a +2 racial bonus on Climb checks because halflings are agile and surefooted. <p class=sub>The master of a lizard familiar (see the Familiars sidebar, page 52) gains a +3 bonus on Climb checks. <p class=sub>If you have the Athletic feat, you get a +2 bonus on Climb checks. <p class=sub>A creature with a climb speed (such as a monstrous spider, or a character under the effect of a <i>spider climb</i> spell) has a +8 racial bonus on all Climb checks. The creature must make a Climb check to climb any wall or slope with a DC higher than 0, but it always can choose to take 10 (see Checks without Rolls, page 65), even if rushed or threatened while climbing. If a creature with a climb speed chooses an accelerated climb (see above), it moves at double its climb speed (or at its land speed, whichever is slower) and makes a single Climb check at a -5 penalty. Such a creature retains its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) while climbing, and opponents get no special bonus to their attacks against it. It cannot, however, use the run action while climbing. <p class=sub><b>Synergy</b>: If you have 5 or more ranks in Use Rope, you get a +2 bonus on Climb checks made to climb a rope, a knotted rope, or a rope-and-wall combination.",

Such actions include casting a spell, concentrating on an active spell (such as detect magic), directing a spell (such as spiritual weapon), using a spell-like ability (such as a paladin&#39;s remove disease ability), or using a skill that would provoke an attack of opportunity (such as Disable Device, Heal, Open Lock, and Use Rope, among others). In general, if an action wouldn&#39;t normally provoke an attack of opportunity, you need not make a Concentration check to avoid being distracted. <p class=sub>If the Concentration check succeeds, you may continue with the action as normal. If the check fails, the action automatically fails and is wasted. If you were in the process of casting a spell, the spell is lost (see Cast a Spell, page 140).

A skill use also fails, and in some cases a failed skill check may have other ramifications as well. <p class=sub>The table below summarizes various types of distractions that cause you to make a Concentration check. If the distraction occurs while you are trying to cast a spell, you must add the level of the spell you are trying to cast to the appropriate Concentration DC (See Concentration, page 170, for more information).

This doesn&#39;t apply to other actions that might provoke attacks of opportunity (such as movement or loading a crossbow). The DC of the check is 15 (plus the spell&#39;s level, if casting a spell or using a spell-like ability defensively).

	detail: "You are trained in a craft, trade, or art, such as alchemy, armor-smithing, basketweaving, bookbinding, bowmaking, blacksmithing, calligraphy, carpentry, cobbling, gemcutting, leatherworking, locksmithing, painting, pottery, sculpting, shipmaking, stonema-sonry, trapmaking, weaponsmithing, or weaving. <p class=sub>Like Knowledge, Perform, and Profession, Craft is actually a number of separate skills. For instance, you could have the skill Craft (carpentry). Your ranks in that skill don&#39;t affect any Craft (pottery) or Craft (leatherworking) checks you might make. You could have several Craft skills, each with its own ranks, each purchased as a separate skill. <p class=sub>A Craft skill is specifically focused on creating something. If nothing is created by the endeavor, it probably falls under the heading of a Profession skill (page 80). <p class=sub><b>Check</b>: You can practice your trade and make a decent living, earning about half your check result in gold pieces per week of dedicated work. You know how to use the tools of your trade, how to perform the craft&#39;s daily tasks, how to supervise untrained helpers, and how to handle common problems. (Untrained laborers and assistants earn an average of 1 silver piece per day.) <p class=sub>The basic function of the Craft skill, however, is to allow you to make an item of the appropriate type. The DC depends on the complexity of the item to be created. The DC, your check results, and the price of the item determine how long it takes to make a particular item. (In the game world, is it the skill level required, the time required, and the raw materials required that determine an item&#39;s price.) <p class=sub>In some cases, the <i>fabricate</i> spell(page 229) can be used to achieve the results of a Craft check with no actual check involved. However, you must make an appropriate Craft check when using the spell to make articles requiring a high degree of craftsmanship (jewelry, swords, glass, crystal, and so forth). <p class=sub>A successful Craft check related to woodworking in conjunction with the casting of the <i>ironwood</i> spell (page 246) enables you to make wooden items that have the strength of steel. <p class=sub>When casting the spell <i>minor creation</i> (page 253), you must succeed on an appropriate Craft check to make a complex item. For instance, a successful Craft (bowmaking) check might be required to make straight arrow shafts. <p class=sub>All crafts require artisan&#39;s tools (page 129) to give the best chance of success. If improvised tools are used, the check is made with a -2 circumstance penalty. On the other hand, masterwork artisan&#39;s tools provide a +2 circumstance bonus on the check. <p class=sub>To determine how much time and money it takes to make an item, follow these steps.<ol><li>Find the item&#39;s price in Chapter 7: Equipment of this book or in the <i>Dungeon Master&#39;s Guide</i>, or have the DM set the price for an item not otherwise described. Put the price in silver pieces (1 gp = 10 sp). <li>Find the DC from the table below, or have the DM set one. <li>Pay one-third of the item&#39;s price for the cost of raw materials. <li>Make an appropriate Craft check representing one week&#39;s work. If the check succeeds, multiply your check result by the DC. If the result x the DC equals the price of the item in sp, then you have completed the item. (If the result x the DC equals double or triple the price of the item in silver pieces, then you&#39;ve completed the task in one-half or one-third of the time. Other multiples of the DC reduce the time in the same manner.) If the result x the DC doesn&#39;t equal the price, then it represents the progress you&#39;ve made this week. Record the result and make a new Craft check for the next week.

In this case your progress (check result x DC) is in copper pieces instead of silver pieces. <p class=sub><i>Creating Masterwork Items</i>: You can make a masterwork item--a weapon, suit of armor, shield, or tool that conveys a bonus on its use through its exceptional craftsmanship, not through being magical. To create a masterwork item, you create the masterwork component as if it were a separate item in addition to the standard item. The masterwork component has its own price (300 gp for a weapon or 150 gp for a suit of armor or a shield) and a Craft DC of 20. Once both the standard component and the masterwork component are completed, the masterwork item is finished. Note: The cost you pay for the masterwork component is one-third of the given amount, just as it is for the cost in raw materials. <p class=sub><i>Repairing Items</i>: Generally, you can repair an item by making checks against the same DC that it took to make the item in the first place.

This allows you to create the item more quickly (since you&#39;ll be multiplying this higher DC by your Craft check result to determine progress). You must decide whether to increase the DC before you make each weekly or daily check. <p class=sub>To make an item using Craft (alchemy), you must have alchemical equipment and be a spellcaster. If you are working in a city, you can buy what you need as part of the raw materials cost to make the item, but alchemical equipment is difficult or impossible to come by in some places.

Alternatively, you can command the animal to defend a specific other character. <p class=sub>Down (DC 15): The animal breaks off from combat or otherwise backs down. An animal that doesn&#39;t know this trick continues to fight until it must flee (due to injury, a fear effect, or the like) or its opponent is defeated. <p class=sub>Fetch (DC 15): The animal goes and gets something.

It does not challenge other creatures that come by, though it still defends itself if it needs to. <p class=sub>Track (DC 20): The animal tracks the scent presented to it.

If the package includes more than three tricks, the animal must have an Intelligence score of 2. <p class=sub>An animal can be trained for only one general purpose, though if the creature is capable of learning additional tricks (above and beyond those included in its general purpose), it may do so. Training an animal for a purpose requires fewer checks than teaching individual tricks does, but no less time. At your DM&#39;s option, you may be able to train an animal for a purpose that isn&#39;t mentioned here. <p class=sub>Combat Riding (DC 20): An animal trained to bear a rider into combat knows the tricks attack, come, defend, down, guard, and heel. Training an animal for combat riding takes six weeks. You may also &#39;upgrade&#39; an animal trained for riding to one trained for combat riding by spending three weeks and making a successful DC 20 Handle Animal check. The new general purpose and tricks completely replace the animal&#39;s previous purpose and any tricks it once knew. Warhorses and riding dogs (see the Monster Manual) are already trained to bear riders into combat, and they don&#39;t require any additional training for this purpose. <p class=sub>Fighting (DC 20): An animal trained to engage in combat knows the tricks attack, down, and stay. Training an animal for fighting takes three weeks. <p class=sub>Guarding (DC 20): An animal trained to guard knows the tricks attack, defend, down, and guard. Training an animal for guarding takes four weeks. <p class=sub>Heavy Labor (DC 15): An animal trained for heavy labor knows the tricks come and work. Training an animal for heavy labor takes two weeks. <p class=sub>Hunting (DC 20): An animal trained for hunting knows the tricks attack, down, fetch, heel, seek, and track. Training an animal for hunting takes six weeks. <p class=sub>Performance (DC 15): An animal trained for performance knows the tricks come, fetch, heel, perform, and stay. Training an animal for performance takes five weeks. <p class=sub>Riding (DC 15): An animal trained to bear a rider knows the tricks come, heel, and stay. Training an animal for riding takes three weeks. <p class=sub><i>Rear a Wild Animal</i>: To rear an animal means to raise a wild creature from infancy so that it becomes domesticated. A handler can rear as many as three creatures of the same kind at once. A successfully domesticated animal can be taught tricks at the same time it&#39;s being raised, or it can be taught as a domesticated animal later. <p class=sub><b>Action</b>: Varies. Handling an animal is a move action, while pushing an animal is a full-round action. (A druid or ranger can handle her animal companion as a free action or push it as a move action.) For tasks with specific time frames noted above, you must spend half this time (at the rate of 3 hours per day per animal being handled) working toward completion of the task before you attempt the Handle Animal check. If the check fails, your attempt to teach, rear, or train the animal fails and you need not complete the teaching, rearing, or training time. If the check succeeds, you must invest the remainder of the time to complete the teaching, rearing, or training. If the time is interrupted or the task is not followed through to completion, the attempt to teach, rear, or train the animal automatically fails. <p class=sub><b>Try Again</b>: Yes, except for rearing an animal. <p class=sub><b>Special</b>: You can use this skill on a creature with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2 that is not an animal, but the DC of any such check increases by 5. Such creatures have the same limit on tricks known as animals do. The Monster Manual provides information on teaching or training other kinds of creatures as appropriate. <p class=sub>A druid or ranger gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Handle Animal checks involving her animal companion. In addition, a druid&#39;s or ranger&#39;s animal companion knows one or more bonus tricks, which don&#39;t count against the normal limit on tricks known and don&#39;t require any training time or Handle Animal checks to teach. <p class=sub>If you have the Animal Affinity feat, you get a +2 bonus on Handle Animal checks. <p class=sub><b>Synergy</b>: If you have 5 or more ranks in Handle Animal, you get a +2 bonus on Ride checks and wild empathy checks. <p class=sub><b>Untrained</b>: If you have no ranks in Handle Animal, you can use a Charisma check to handle and push domestic animals, but you can&#39;t teach, rear, or train animals. A druid or ranger with no ranks in Handle Animal can use a Charisma check to handle and push her animal companion, but she can&#39;t teach, rear, or train other nondomestic animals.", type: "skill", tags: ["phb"]

If a character has negative hit points and is losing hit points (at the rate of 1 per round, 1 per hour, or 1 per day), you can make him or her stable. A stable character regains no hit points but stops losing them. (See Dying, page 145.) <p class=sub><i>Long-Term Care</i>: Providing long-term care means treating a wounded person for a day or more. If your Heal check is successful,the patient recovers hit points or ability score points (lost to ability damage) at twice the normal rate: 2 hit points per level for a full 8 hours of rest in a day, or 4 hit points per level for each full day of complete rest; 2 ability score points for a full 8 hours of rest in a day, or 4 ability score points for each full day of complete rest. You can tend as many as six patients at a time. You need a few items and supplies (bandages, salves, and so on) that are easy to come by in settled lands. <p class=sub>Giving long-term care counts as light activity for the healer. You cannot give long-term care to yourself. <p class=sub><i>Treat Wound from Caltrop, Spike Growth, or Spike Stones</i>: A creature wounded by stepping on a caltrop moves at one-half normal speed. A successful Heal check removes this movement penalty. <p class=sub>A creature wounded by a <i>spike growth</i> or<i>spike stones</i> spell must succeed on a Reflex save or take injuries that reduce his speed by one-third. Another character can remove this penalty by taking 10 minutes to dress the victim&#39;s injuries and succeeding on a Heal check against the spell&#39;s save DC.<i>Treat Poison</i>: To treat poison means to tend a single character who has been poisoned and who is going to take more damage from the poison (or suffer some other effect). Every time the poisoned character makes a saving throw against the poison, you make a Heal check. The poisoned character uses your check result or his or her saving throw, whichever is higher. <p class=sub><i>Treat Disease</i>: To treat a disease means to tend a single diseased character. Every time he or she makes a saving throw against disease effects, you make a Heal check. The diseased character uses your check result or his or her saving throw, whichever is higher. <p class=sub><b>Action</b>: Providing first aid, treating a wound, or treating poison is a standard action. Treating a disease or tending a creature wounded by a  spike growth or  spike stones spell takes 10 minutes of work. Providing long-term care requires 8 hours of light activity. <p class=sub><b>Try Again</b>: Varies. Generally speaking, you can&#39;t try a Heal check again without proof of the original check&#39;s failure. For instance, until a poisoned character makes a saving throw against the poisoned wound you&#39;ve treated, you can&#39;t know whether your Heal check was successful or not, so you can&#39;t retry the check. You can always retry a check to provide first aid, assuming the target of the previous attempt is still alive. <p class=sub><b>Special</b>: A character with the Self-Sufficient feat gets a +2 bonus on Heal checks. <p class=sub>A healer&#39;s kit (page 130) gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Heal checks.", type: "skill", tags: ["phb"]

You can move up to one-half your normal speed and hide at no penalty. When moving at a speed greater than one-half but less than your normal speed, you take a -5 penalty. It&#39;s practically impossible (-20 penalty) to hide while attacking, running or charging. <p class=sub>For example, Lidda has a speed of 20 feet. If she doesn&#39;t want to take a penalty on her Hide check, she can move only 10 feet as a move action (up to a maximum of 20 feet in a round). <p class=sub>A creature larger or smaller than Medium takes a size bonus or penalty on Hide checks depending on its size category: Fine +16, Diminutive +12, Tiny +8, Small +4, Large -4, Huge -8, Gargantuan -12, Colossal -16. <p class=sub>You need cover or concealment (see pages 150-152) in order to attempt a Hide check. Total cover or total concealment usually (but not always; see Special, below) obviates the need for a Hide check, since nothing can see you anyway. <p class=sub>If people are observing you, even casually, you can&#39;t hide. You can run around a corner or behind cover so that you&#39;re out of sight and then hide, but the others then know at least where you went. If your observers are momentarily distracted (such as by a Bluff check; see below), though, you can attempt to hide. While the others turn their attention from you, you can attempt a Hide check if you can get to a hiding place of some kind. (As a general guideline, the hiding place has to be within 1 foot per rank you have in Hide.) This check, however, is made at a -10 penalty because you have to move fast. <p class=sub><i>Sniping</i>: If you&#39;ve already successfully hidden at least 10 feet from your target, you can make one ranged attack, then immediately hide again. You take a -20 penalty on your Hide check to conceal yourself after the shot. <p class=sub><i>Creating a Diversion to Hide</i>: You can use Bluff (page 67) to help you hide. A successful Bluff check can give you the momentary diversion you need to attempt a Hide check while people are aware of you. <p class=sub><b>Action</b>: Usually none. Normally, you make a Hide check as part of movement, so it doesn&#39;t take a separate action. However, hiding immediately after a ranged attack (see Sniping, above) is a move action. <p class=sub><b>Special</b>: If you are invisible, you gain a +40 bonus on Hide checks if you are immobile, or a +20 bonus on Hide checks if you&#39;re moving. <p class=sub>If you have the Stealthy feat, you get a +2 bonus on Hide checks. <p class=sub>A 13th-level ranger can attempt a Hide check in any sort of natural terrain, even if it doesn&#39;t grant cover or concealment.

Intimidation includes verbal threats and body language. <p class=sub><b>Check</b>: You can change another's behavior with a successful check. Your Intimidate check is opposed by the target's modified level check (1d20 + character level or Hit Dice + target's Wisdom bonus [if any] + target's modifiers on saves against fear). If you beat your target's check result, you may treat the target as friendly, but only for the purpose of actions taken while it remains intimidated. (That is, the target retains its normal attitude, but will chat, advise, offer limited help, or advocate on your behalf while intimidated. See the Diplomacy skill, above, for additional details.) The effect lasts as long as the target remains in your presence, and for 1d6x10 minutes afterward. After this time, the target's default attitude toward you shifts to unfriendly (or, if normally unfriendly, to hostile). <p class=sub>If you fail the check by 5 or more, the target provides you with incorrect or useless information, or otherwise frustrates your efforts. <p class=sub><b>Demoralize Opponent</b>: You can also use Intimidate to weaken an opponent's resolve in combat. To do so, make an Intimidate check opposed by the target's modified level check (see above). If you win, the target becomes shaken for 1 round. A shaken character takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. You can intimidate only an opponent that you threaten in melee combat and that can see you. <p class=sub><b>Action</b>: Varies. Changing another's behavior requires 1 minute of interaction. Intimidating an opponent in combat is a standard action. <p class=sub><b>Try Again</b>: Optional, but not recommended because retries usually do not work. Even if the initial check succeeds, the other character can be intimidated only so far, and a retry doesn't help.

If your speed is 30 feet (the speed of an unarmored human), then no modifier based on speed applies to the check. If your speed is less than 30 feet, you take a -6 penalty for every 10 feet of speed less than 30 feet. If your speed is greater than 30 feet, you gain a +4 bonus for every 10 feet beyond 30 feet. For instance, if you have a speed of 20 feet, you take a -6 penalty on your Jump checks. If, on the other hand, your speed is 50 feet, you gain a +8 bonus. <p class=sub>All Jump DCs given here assume that you get a running start, which requires that you move at least 20 feet in a straight line before attempting the jump. If you do not get a running start, the DC for the jump is doubled. <p class=sub>Distance moved by jumping is counted against your normal maximum movement in a round. For example, Krusk has a speed of 40 feet. If he moves 30 feet, then jumps across a 10-foot-wide chasm, he's then moved 40 feet total, so that's his move action. <p class=sub>If you have ranks in Jump and you succeed on a Jump check, you land on your feet (when appropriate). If you attempt a Jump check untrained, you land prone unless you beat the DC by 5 or more. <p class=sub><i>Long Jump</i>: A long jump is a horizontal jump, made across a gap like a chasm or stream. At the midpoint of the jump, you attain a vertical height equal to one-quarter of the horizontal distance. The DC for the jump is equal to the distance jumped (in feet). For example, a 10-foot-wide pit requires a DC 10 Jump check to cross. <p class=sub>If your check succeeds, you land on your feet at the far end. If you fail the check by less than 5, you don't clear the distance, but you can make a DC 15 Reflex save to grab the far edge of the gap. You end your movement grasping the far edge.

For example, the DC for a high jump to land atop a 3-foot-high ledge is 12 (3 x 4). <p class=sub>If you jumped up to grab something, a successful check indicates that you reached the desired height. If you wish to pull yourself up, you can do so with a move action and a DC 15 Climb check.

Doing so counts as 10 feet of movement, so if your speed is 30 feet, you could move 20 feet, then hop up onto a counter. You do not need to get a running start to hop up, so the DC is not doubled if you do not get a running start. <p class=sub><i>Jumping Down</i>: If you intentionally jump from a height, you take less damage than you would if you just fell.

You do not have to get a running start to jump down, so the DC is not doubled if you do not get a running start. <p class=sub>If you succeed on the check, you take falling damage as if you had dropped 10 fewer feet than you actually did. Thus, if you jump down from a height of just 10 feet, you take no damage. If you jump down from a height of 20 feet, you take damage as if you had fallen 10 feet. <p class=sub><b>Action</b>: None. A Jump check is included in your movement, so it is part of a move action.

You can activate such an item as if you were using the activation word, thought, or action, even when you&apos;re not and even if you don&apos;t know it. You do have to perform some equivalent activity in order to make the check. That is, you must speak, wave the item around, or otherwise attempt to get it to activate. You get a special +2 bonus on your Use Magic Device check if you&apos;ve activated the item in question at least once before. <p class=sub>If you fail by 9 or less, you can&apos;t activate the device. If you fail by 10 or more, you suffer a mishap. A mishap means that magical energy gets released but it doesn&apos;t do what you wanted it to do. The DM determines the result of a mishaps, as with scroll mishaps. The default mishaps are that the item affects the wrong target or that un-controlled magical energy is released, dealing 2d6 points of damage to you. This mishap is in addition to the chance for a mishap that you normally run when you cast a spell from a scroll that you could not otherwise cast yourself (see the <i>Dungeon Master&apos;s Guide</i>). <p class=sub><i>Decipher a Written Spell</i>: This usage works just like deciphering a written spell with the Spellcraft skill, except that the DC is 5 points higher. Deciphering a written spell requires 1 minute of concentration. <p class=sub><i>Emulate an Ability Score</i>: To cast a spell from a scroll, you need a high score in the appropriate ability (Intelligence for wizard spells, Wisdom for divine spells, or Charisma for sorcerer or bard spells). Your effective ability score (appropriate to the class you&apos;re emulating when you try to cast the spell from the scroll) is your Use Magic Device check result minus 15. If you already have a high enough score in the appropriate ability, you don&apos;t need to make this check. <p class=sub><i>Emulate an Alignment</i>: Some magic items have positive or negative effects based on the user&apos;s alignment. Use Magic Device lets you use these items as if you were of an alignment of your choice. For example, a book of vile darkness damages nonevil characters who touch it. With a successful Use Magic Device check, Lidda could emulate an evil alignment so that she could handle a <i>book of vile darkness</i> safely. You can emulate only one alignment at a time. Lidda finds that using a magic device can be risky. <p class=sub><i>Emulate a Class Feature</i>: Sometimes you need to use a class feature to activate a magic item. In this case, your effective level in the emulated class equals your Use Magic Device check result minus 20. For example, Lidda finds a magic chalice that turns regular water into holy water when a cleric or an experienced paladin channels positive energy into it as if turning undead. She attempts to activate the item by emulating the cleric&apos;s undead turning ability. Her effective cleric level is her check result minus 20. Since a cleric can turn undead at 1st level, she needs a Use Magic Device check result of 21 or higher to succeed. <p class=sub>This skill does not let you actually use the class feature of another class. It just lets you activate items as if you had that class feature. If the class whose feature you are emulating has an alignment requirement, you must meet it, either honestly or by emulating an appropriate alignment with a separate Use Magic Device check (see above). <p class=sub><i>Emulate a Race</i>: Some magic items work only for members of certain races, or work better for members of those races. You can use such an item as if you were a race of your choice. For example, Lidda, a halfling, could attempt to use a <i>dwarven thrower</i> (see page 226 of the <i>Dungeon Master&apos;s Guide</i>) as if she were a dwarf. If she failed her Use Magic Device check, the hammer would work for her as it normally would for a halfling, but if she succeeded, it would work for her as if she were a dwarf. You can emulate only one race at a time. <p class=sub><i>Use a Scroll</i>: If you are casting a spell from a scroll, you have to decipher it first. Normally, to cast a spell from a scroll, you must have the scroll&apos;s spell on your class spell list. Use Magic Device allows you to use a scroll as if you had a particular spell on your class spell list. The DC is equal to 20 + the caster level of the spell you are trying to cast from the scroll. For instance, to cast web (a 2nd-level wizard spell) from a scroll, you would need a Use Magic Device check result of 23 or better, since the minimum caster level for web is 3rd level. See the <i>Dungeon Master&apos;s Guide</i> for more information on scrolls. <p class=sub>In addition, casting a spell from a scroll requires a minimum score (10 + spell level) in the appropriate ability. If you don&apos;t have a sufficient score in that ability, you must emulate the ability score with a separate Use Magic Device check (see above). <p class=sub>This use of the skill also applies to other spell completion magic items. The <i>Dungeon Master&apos;s Guide</i> has more information on such items. <p class=sub><i>Use a Wand</i>: Normally, to use a wand, you must have the wand&apos;s spell on your class spell list. This use of the skill allows you to use a wand as if you had a particular spell on your class spell list. This use of the skill also applies to other spell trigger magic items, such as staffs. The <i>Dungeon Master&apos;s Guide</i> has more information on such items. <p class=sub><b>Action</b>: None. The Use Magic Device check is made as part of the action (if any) required to activate the magic item. (See Activate Magic Item, page 142, and the <i>Dungeon Master&apos;s Guide</i> for discussions of how magic items are normally activated.) <p class=sub><b>Try Again</b>: Yes, but if you ever roll a natural 1 while attempting to activate an item and you fail, then you can&apos;t try to activate that item again for 24 hours. <p class=sub><b>Special</b>: You cannot take 10 with this skill. <p class=sub>You can&apos;t aid another on Use Magic Device checks.
