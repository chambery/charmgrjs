The base DC to make a jump is equal to the distance to be crossed (if horizontal) or four times the height to be reached (if vertical). These DCs double if you do not have at least 10 feet of space to get a running start. The only Acrobatics modifiers that apply are those concerning the surface you are jumping from. If you fail this check by 4 or less, you can attempt a DC 20 Ref lex save to grab hold of the other side after having missed the jump. If you fail by 5 or more, you fail to make the jump and fall (or land prone, in the case of a vertical jump).

Creatures with a base land speed below 30 feet receive a -4 racial bonus on Acrobatics checks made to jump for every 10 feet of their speed below 30 feet. No jump can allow you to exceed your maximum movement for the round.

	detail: "You know how to tell a lie. <p class=sub><strong>Check: </strong>Bluff is an opposed skill check against your opponent&apos;s Sense Motive skill. If you use Bluff to fool someone, with a successful check you convince your opponent that what you are saying is true. Bluff checks are modified depending upon the believability of the lie. The following modifiers are applied to the roll of the creature attempting to tell the lie.

The DC of this check is equal to 10 + your opponent&apos;s base attack bonus + your opponent&apos;s Wisdom modifier. If your opponent is trained in Sense Motive, the DC is instead equal to 10 + your opponent&apos;s Sense Motive bonus, if higher. For more information on feinting in combat, see Chapter 8.	<p class=sub><i>Secret Messages</i>You can use Bluff to pass hidden messages along to another character without others understanding your true meaning by using innuendo to cloak your actual message. The DC of this check is 15 for simple messages and 20 for complex messages. If you are successful, the target automatically understands you, assuming you are communicating in a language that it understands. If your check fails by 5 or more, you deliver the wrong message. Other creatures that receive the message can decipher it by succeeding at an opposed Sense Motive check against your Bluff result. <p class=sub><strong>Action</strong>Attempting to deceive someone takes at least 1 round, but can possibly take longer if the lie is elaborate (as determined by the GM on a case-by-case basis). Feinting in combat is a standard action. Using Bluff to deliver a secret message takes twice as long as the message would otherwise take to relay. <p class=sub><strong>Try Again</strong>If you fail to deceive someone, further attempts to deceive them are at a -10 penalty and may be impossible (GM discretion). <p class=sub>You can attempt to feint against someone again if you fail. Secret messages can be relayed again if the first attempt fails. <p class=sub><strong>Special</strong>A spellcaster with a viper familiar gains a +3 bonus on Bluff checks. If you have the Deceitful feat, you get a bonus on Bluff checks (see Chapter 5)."

	detail: "You are skilled at scaling vertical surfaces, from smooth city walls to rocky cliffs. <p class=sub> <strong>Check: </strong>With a successful Climb check, you can advance up, down, or across a slope, wall, or other steep incline (or even across a ceiling, provided it has handholds) at one-quarter your normal speed. A slope is considered to be any incline at an angle measuring less than 60 degrees; a wall is any incline at an angle measuring 60 degrees or more. <p class=sub>A Climb check that fails by 4 or less means that you make no progress, and one that fails by 5 or more means that you fall from whatever height you have already attained. <p class=sub>The DC of the check depends on the conditions of the climb. Compare the task with those on the following table to determine an appropriate DC. <table class=pftable> <tr> <th class=pftable>Climb DC</th> <th class=pftable>Example Surface or Activity</th> </tr> <tr> <td class='pftable number'>0</td> <td class=pftable>A slope too steep to walk up, or a knotted rope with a wall to brace against.</td> </tr> <tr> <td class='pftable number'>5</td> <td class=pftable>A rope with a wall to brace against, or a knotted rope, or a rope affected by the rope trick spell.</td> </tr> <tr> <td class='pftable number'>10</td> <td class=pftable>A surface with ledges to hold on to and stand on, such as a very rough wall or a ship&apos;s rigging.</td> </tr> <tr> <td class='pftable number'>15</td> <td class=pftable>Any surface with adequate handholds and footholds (natural or artificial), such as a very rough natural rock surface or a tree, or an unknotted rope, or pulling yourself up when dangling by your hands.</td> </tr> <tr> <td class='pftable number'>20</td> <td class=pftable>An uneven surface with narrow handholds and footholds, such as a typical wall in a dungeon.</td> </tr> <tr> <td class='pftable number'>25</td> <td class=pftable>A rough surface, such as a natural rock wall or a brick wall</td>. </tr> <tr> <td class='pftable number'>30</td> <td class=pftable>An overhang or ceiling with handholds only.</td> </tr><tr> <td class='pftable number'>&mdash;</td> <td class=pftable>A perfectly smooth, flat vertical (or inverted) surface cannot be climbed.</td> </tr> </table> <table class=pftable> <tr> <th class=pftable>Climb DC Modifier*</th> <th class=pftable>Example Surface or Activity</th> </tr> <tr> <td class='pftable number'>-10</td> <td class=pftable>Climbing a chimney (artificial or natural) or other location where you can brace against two opposite walls.</td> </tr> <tr> <td class='pftable number'>-5</td> <td class=pftable>Climbing a corner where you can brace against perpendicular walls.</td> </tr> <tr> <td class='pftable number'>+5</td> <td class=pftable>Surface is slippery.</td> </tr> </table> <p class=sub>* These modifiers are cumulative; use all that apply. <p class=sub>You need both hands free to climb, but you may cling to a wall with one hand while you cast a spell or take some other action that requires only one hand. While climbing, you can&apos;t move to avoid a blow, so you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC (if any). You also can&apos;t use a shield while climbing. Anytime you take damage while climbing, make a Climb check against the DC of the slope or wall. Failure means you fall from your current height and sustain the appropriate falling damage. <p class=sub> <i>Accelerated Climbing: </i>You try to climb more quickly than normal. By accepting a -5 penalty, you can move half your speed (instead of one-quarter your speed). Make Your Own Handholds and Footholds: You can make your own handholds and footholds by pounding pitons into a wall. Doing so takes 1 minute per piton, and one piton is needed per 5 feet of distance. As with any surface that offers handholds and footholds, a wall with pitons in it has a DC of 15. In the same way, a climber with a handaxe or similar implement can cut handholds in an ice wall. <p class=sub> <i>Catch Yourself When Falling: </i>It&apos;s practically impossible to catch yourself on a wall while falling, yet if you wish to attempt such a difficult task, you can make a Climb check (DC = wall&apos;s DC + 20) to do so. It&apos;s much easier to catch yourself on a slope (DC = slope&apos;s DC + 10). <p class=sub> <i>Catch a Falling Character While Climbing: </i>If someone climbing above you or adjacent to you falls, you can attempt to catch the falling character if he or she is within your reach. Doing so requires a successful melee touch attack against the falling character (though he or she can voluntarily forego any Dexterity bonus to AC if desired). If you hit, you must immediately attempt a Climb check (DC = wall&apos;s DC + 10). Success indicates that you catch the falling character, but his total weight, including equipment, cannot exceed your heavy load limit or you automatically fall. If you fail your Climb check by 4 or less, you fail to stop the character&apos;s fall but don&apos;t lose your grip on the wall. If you fail by 5 or more, you fail to stop the character&apos;s fall and begin falling as well. <p class=sub> <strong>Action: </strong>Climbing is part of movement, so it&apos;s generally part of a move action (and may be combined with other types of movement in a move action). Each move action that includes any climbing requires a separate Climb check. Catching yourself or another falling character doesn&apos;t take an action. <p class=sub> <strong>Special: </strong>You can use a rope to haul a character upward (or lower a character) through sheer strength. You can lift double your maximum load in this manner. <p class=sub>A creature with a climb speed has a +8 racial bonus on all Climb checks. The creature must make a Climb check to climb any wall or slope with a DC higher than 0, but it can always choose to take 10, even if rushed or threatened while climbing. If a creature with a climb speed chooses an accelerated climb (see above), it moves at double its climb speed (or at its land speed, whichever is slower) and makes a single Climb check at a -5 penalty. Such a creature retains its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) while climbing, and opponents get no special bonus to their attacks against it. It cannot, however, use the run action while climbing. <p class=sub>If you have the Athletic feat, you get a bonus on Climb checks (see Chapter 5)."

	detail: "You are skilled in the creation of a specific group of items, such as armor or weapons. Like Knowledge, Perform, and Profession, Craft is actually a number of separate skills. You could have several Craft skills, each with its own ranks. The most common Craft skills are alchemy, armor, baskets, books, bows, calligraphy, carpentry, cloth, clothing, glass, jewelry, leather, locks, paintings, pottery, sculptures, ships, shoes, stonemasonry, traps, and weapons. <p class=sub>A Craft skill is specifically focused on creating something. If nothing is created by the endeavor, it probably falls under the heading of a Profession skill. <p class=sub><b>Check: </b>You can practice your trade and make a decent living, earning half your check result in gold pieces per week of dedicated work. You know how to use the tools of your trade, how to perform the craft&apos;s daily tasks, how to supervise untrained helpers, and how to handle common problems. (Untrained laborers and assistants earn an average of 1 silver piece per day.) <p class=sub>The basic function of the Craft skill, however, is to allow you to make an item of the appropriate type. The DC depends on the complexity of the item to be created. The DC, your check result, and the price of the item determine how long it takes to make a particular item. The item&apos;s finished price also determines the cost of raw materials. <p class=sub>In some cases, the <i>fabricate</i> spell can be used to achieve the results of a Craft check with no actual check involved. You must still make an appropriate Craft check when using the spell to make articles requiring a high degree of craftsmanship. <p class=sub>A successful Craft check related to woodworking in conjunction with the casting of the ironwood spell enables you to make wooden items that have the strength of steel. <p class=sub>When casting the spell <i>minor creation</i>, you must succeed on an appropriate Craft check to make a complex item. All crafts require artisan&apos;s tools to give the best chance of success. If improvised tools are used, the check is made with a -2 penalty. On the other hand, masterwork artisan&apos;s tools provide a +2 circumstance bonus on the check. <p class=sub>To determine how much time and money it takes to make an item, follow these steps. <p class=sub><ol><li>Find the item&apos;s price in silver pieces (1 gp = 10 sp).</li> <p class=sub><li>Find the item&apos;s DC from Table 4-4.</li> <p class=sub><li>Pay 1/3 of the item&apos;s price for the raw material cost.</li> <p class=sub><li>Make an appropriate Craft check representing one week&apos;s worth of work. If the check succeeds, multiply your check result by the DC. If the result x the DC equals the price of the item in sp, then you have completed the item. (If the result x the DC equals double or triple the price of the item in silver pieces, then you&apos;ve completed the task in one-half or onethird of the time. Other multiples of the DC reduce the time in the same manner.) If the result x the DC doesn&apos;t equal the price, then it represents the progress you&apos;ve made this week. Record the result and make a new Craft check for the next week. Each week, you make more progress until your total reaches the price of the item in silver pieces. </li></ol> <p class=sub>If you fail a check by 4 or less, you make no progress this week. If you fail by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and have to pay half the original raw material cost again. <p class=sub>Progress by the Day: You can make checks by the day instead of by the week. In this case your progress (check result x DC) should be divided by the number of days in a week. <p class=sub><i>Create Masterwork Items: </i>You can make a masterwork item: a weapon, suit of armor, shield, or tool that conveys a bonus on its use through its exceptional craftsmanship. To create a masterwork item, you create the masterwork component as if it were a separate item in addition to the standard item. The masterwork component has its own price (300 gp for a weapon or 150 gp for a suit of armor or a shield, see Chapter 6 for the price of other masterwork tools) and a Craft DC of 20. Once both the standard component and the masterwork component are completed, the masterwork item is finished. The cost you pay for the masterwork component is one-third of the given amount, just as it is for the cost in raw materials. <p class=sub><i>Repair Items: </i>You can repair an item by making checks against the same DC that it took to make the item in the first place. The cost of repairing an item is one-fifth of the item&apos;s price. <p class=sub><b>Action: </b>Does not apply. Craft checks are made by the day or week (see above). <p class=sub><b>Try Again: </b>Yes, but each time you fail by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and have to pay half the original raw material cost again. <p class=sub><b>Special: </b>You may voluntarily add +10 to the indicated DC to craft an item. This allows you to create the item more quickly (since you&apos;ll be multiplying this higher DC by your Craft check result to determine progress). You must decide whether to increase the DC before you make each weekly or daily check. <p class=sub>To make an item using Craft (alchemy), you must have alchemical equipment. If you are working in a city, you can buy what you need as part of the raw materials cost to make the item, but alchemical equipment is difficult or impossible to come by in some places. Purchasing and maintaining an alchemist&apos;s lab grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks because you have the perfect tools for the job, but it does not affect the cost of any items made using the skill. <p class=sub>A gnome receives a +2 bonus on a Craft or Profession skill of her choice. <table class=pftable><tr><th class=pftable>Item </th><th class=pftable>Craft Skill </th><th class=pftable>Craft DC</th></tr> <tr><td class=pftable>Acid </td><td class=pftable>Alchemy </td><td class='pftable number'>15</td></tr> <tr><td class=pftable>Alchemist&apos;s fire, smokestick, or tindertwig </td><td class=pftable>Alchemy </td><td class='pftable number'>20</td></tr> <tr><td class=pftable>Antitoxin, sunrod, tanglefoot bag, or thunderstone </td><td class=pftable>Alchemy </td><td class='pftable number'>25</td></tr> <tr><td class=pftable>Armor or shield </td><td class=pftable>Armor </td><td class='pftable number'>10 + AC bonus</td></tr> <tr><td class=pftable>Longbow, shortbow, or arrows </td><td class=pftable>Bows </td><td class='pftable number'>12</td></tr> <tr><td class=pftable>Composite longbow or composite shortbow </td><td class=pftable>Bows </td><td class='pftable number'>15</td></tr> <tr><td class=pftable>Composite longbow or composite shortbow with high strength rating </td><td class=pftable>Bows </td><td class='pftable number'>15 + (2 x rating)</td></tr> <tr><td class=pftable>Mechanical trap </td><td class=pftable>Traps </td><td class='pftable number'>Varies*</td></tr> <tr><td class=pftable>Crossbow, or bolts </td><td class=pftable>Weapons </td><td class='pftable number'>15</td></tr> <tr><td class=pftable>Simple melee or thrown weapon </td><td class=pftable>Weapons </td><td class='pftable number'>12</td></tr> <tr><td class=pftable>Martial melee or thrown weapon </td><td class=pftable>Weapons </td><td class='pftable number'>15</td></tr> <tr><td class=pftable>Exotic melee or thrown weapon </td><td class=pftable>Weapons </td><td class='pftable number'>18</td></tr> <tr><td class=pftable>Very simple item (wooden spoon) </td><td class=pftable>Varies </td><td class='pftable number'>5</td></tr> <tr><td class=pftable>Typical item (iron pot) </td><td class=pftable>Varies </td><td class='pftable number'>10</td></tr> <tr><td class=pftable>High-quality item (bell) </td><td class='pftable'>Varies </td><td class='pftable number'>15</td></tr> <tr><td class=pftable>Complex or superior item (lock) </td><td class=pftable>Varies </td><td class='pftable number'>20</td></tr> </table> <p class=sub>* Traps have their own rules for construction (see Chapter 13).

This skill is also used to negotiate conf licts by using the proper etiquette and manners suitable to the problem. <p class=sub><b>Check: </b>You can change the initial attitudes of nonplayer characters with a successful check. The DC of this check depends on the creature&apos;s starting attitude toward you, adjusted by its Charisma modifier. If you succeed, the character&apos;s attitude toward you is improved by one step.

This category also covers making an animal perform a forced march or forcing it to hustle for more than 1 hour between sleep cycles. If the animal is wounded or has taken any nonlethal damage or ability score damage, the DC increases by 2. If your check succeeds, the animal performs the task or trick on its next action. <p class=sub><i>Teach an Animal a Trick: </i>You can teach an animal a specific trick with 1 week of work and a successful Handle Animal check against the indicated DC. An animal with an Intelligence score of 1 can learn a maximum of three tricks, while an animal with an Intelligence score of 2 can learn a maximum of six tricks. Possible tricks (and their associated DCs) include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following. <ul><li>Attack (DC 20): The animal attacks apparent enemies. You may point to a particular creature that you wish the animal to attack, and it will comply if able. Normally, an animal will attack only humanoids, monstrous humanoids, giants, or other animals. Teaching an animal to attack all creatures (including such unnatural creatures as undead and aberrations) counts as two tricks. </li> <li>Come (DC 15): The animal comes to you, even if it normally would not do so. </li> <li>Defend (DC 20): The animal defends you (or is ready to defend you if no threat is present), even without any command being given. Alternatively, you can command the animal to defend another specific character. </li> <li>Down (DC 15): The animal breaks off from combat or otherwise backs down. An animal that doesn&apos;t know this trick continues to fight until it must f lee (due to injury, a fear effect, or the like) or its opponent is defeated. </li> <li>Fetch (DC 15): The animal goes and gets something. If you do not point out a specific item, the animal fetches a random object. </li> <li>Guard (DC 20): The animal stays in place and prevents others from approaching. </li> <li>Heel (DC 15): The animal follows you closely, even to places where it normally wouldn&apos;t go. </li> <li>Perform (DC 15): The animal performs a variety of simple tricks, such as sitting up, rolling over, roaring or barking, and so on. </li> <li>Seek (DC 15): The animal moves into an area and looks around for anything that is obviously alive or animate. </li> <li>Stay (DC 15): The animal stays in place, waiting for you to return. It does not challenge other creatures that come by, though it still defends itself if it needs to. </li> <li>Track (DC 20): The animal tracks the scent presented to it. (This requires the animal to have the scent ability.) </li> <li>Work (DC 15): The animal pulls or pushes a medium or heavy load. </li></ul> <p class=sub><i>Train an Animal for a General Purpose: </i>Rather than teaching an animal individual tricks, you can simply train it for a general purpose. Essentially, an animal&apos;s purpose represents a preselected set of known tricks that fit into a common scheme, such as guarding or heavy labor. The animal must meet all the normal prerequisites for all tricks included in the training package. If the package includes more than three tricks, the animal must have an Intelligence score of 2 or higher. <p class=sub>An animal can be trained for only one general purpose, though if the creature is capable of learning additional tricks (above and beyond those included in its general purpose), it may do so. Training an animal for a purpose requires fewer checks than teaching individual tricks does, but no less time. <ul><li>Combat Training (DC 20): An animal trained to bear a rider into combat knows the tricks attack, come, defend, down, guard, and heel. Training an animal for combat riding takes 6 weeks. You may also &quot;upgrade&quot; an animal trained for riding to one trained for combat by spending 3 weeks and making a successful DC 20 Handle Animal check. The new general purpose and tricks completely replace the animal&apos;s previous purpose and any tricks it once knew. Many horses and riding dogs are trained in this way. </li> <li>Fighting (DC 20): An animal trained to engage in combat knows the tricks attack, down, and stay. Training an animal for fighting takes 3 weeks. </li> <li>Guarding (DC 20): An animal trained to guard knows the tricks attack, defend, down, and guard. Training an animal for guarding takes 4 weeks. </li> <li>Heavy Labor (DC 15): An animal trained for heavy labor knows the tricks come and work. Training an animal for heavy labor takes 2 weeks. </li> <li>Hunting (DC 20): An animal trained for hunting knows the tricks attack, down, fetch, heel, seek, and track. Training an animal for hunting takes 6 weeks. </li> <li>Performance (DC 15): An animal trained for performance knows the tricks come, fetch, heel, perform, and stay. Training an animal for performance takes 5 weeks. </li> <li>Riding (DC 15): An animal trained to bear a rider knows the tricks come, heel, and stay. Training an animal for riding takes 3 weeks. </li> </ul> <p class=sub><i>Rear a Wild Animal: </i>To rear an animal means to raise a wild creature from infancy so that it becomes domesticated. A handler can rear as many as three creatures of the same kind at once. <p class=sub>A successfully domesticated animal can be taught tricks at the same time it&apos;s being raised, or it can be taught as a domesticated animal later. <p class=sub><b>Action: </b>Varies. Handling an animal is a move action, while &quot;pushing&quot; an animal is a full-round action. (A druid or ranger can handle an animal companion as a free action or push it as a move action.) For tasks with specific time frames noted above, you must spend half this time (at the rate of 3 hours per day per animal being handled) working toward completion of the task before you attempt the Handle Animal check. If the check fails, your attempt to teach, rear, or train the animal fails and you need not complete the teaching, rearing, or training time. If the check succeeds, you must invest the remainder of the time to complete the teaching, rearing, or training. If the time is interrupted or the task is not followed through to completion, the attempt to teach, rear, or train the animal automatically fails. <p class=sub><b>Try Again: </b>Yes, except for rearing an animal. <p class=sub><b>Special: </b>You can use this skill on a creature with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2 that is not an animal, but the DC of any such check increases by 5. Such creatures have the same limit on tricks known as animals do. <p class=sub>A druid or ranger gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Handle Animal checks involving an animal companion. <p class=sub>In addition, a druid&apos;s or ranger&apos;s animal companion knows one or more bonus tricks, which don&apos;t count against the normal limit on tricks known and don&apos;t require any training time or Handle Animal checks to teach. ] <p class=sub>If you have the Animal Affinity feat, you get a bonus on Handle Animal checks (see Chapter 5). <p class=sub><b>Untrained: </b>If you have no ranks in Handle Animal, you can use a Charisma check to handle and push domestic animals, but you can&apos;t teach, rear, or train animals.

If a character has negative hit points and is losing hit points (at the rate of 1 per round, 1 per hour, or 1 per day), you can make him stable. A stable character regains no hit points but stops losing them. First aid also stops a character from losing hit points due to effects that cause bleed (see Appendix 2 for rules on bleed damage). <p class=sub><i>Long-Term Care: </i>Providing long-term care means treating a wounded person for a day or more. If your Heal check is successful, the patient recovers hit points or ability score points lost to ability damage at twice the normal rate: 2 hit points per level for a full 8 hours of rest in a day, or 4 hit points per level for each full day of complete rest; 2 ability score points for a full 8 hours of rest in a day, or 4 ability score points for each full day of complete rest. <p class=sub>You can tend to as many as six patients at a time. You need a few items and supplies (bandages, salves, and so on) that are easy to come by in settled lands. Giving long-term care counts as light activity for the healer. You cannot give long-term care to yourself. <p class=sub><i>Treat Wounds from Caltrops, Spike Growth, or Spike Stones:</i> A creature wounded by stepping on a caltrop moves at half normal speed. A successful Heal check removes this movement penalty. <p class=sub>A creature wounded by a <i>spike growth</i> or <i>spike stones</i> spell must succeed on a Reflex save or take injuries that reduce his speed by one-third. Another character can remove this penalty by taking 10 minutes to dress the victim&apos;s injuries and succeeding on a Heal check against the spell&apos;s save DC. <p class=sub><i>Treat Deadly Wounds: </i>When treating deadly wounds, you can restore hit points to a damaged creature. Treating deadly wounds restores 1 hit point per level of the creature. If you exceed the DC by 5 or more, add your Wisdom modifier (if positive) to this amount. A creature can only benefit from its deadly wounds being treated within 24 hours of being injured and never more than once per day. You must expend two uses from a healer&apos;s kit to perform this task. You take a -2 penalty on your Heal skill check for each use from the healer&apos;s kit that you lack. <p class=sub><i>Treat Poison: </i>To treat poison means to tend to a single character who has been poisoned and who is going to take more damage from the poison (or suffer some other effect). Every time the poisoned character makes a saving throw against the poison, you make a Heal check. If your Heal check exceeds the DC of the poison, the character receives a +4 competence bonus on his saving throw against the poison. <p class=sub><i>Treat Disease: </i>To treat a disease means to tend to a single diseased character. Every time the diseased character makes a saving throw against disease effects, you make a Heal check. If your Heal check exceeds the DC of the disease, the character receives a +4 competence bonus on his saving throw against the disease. <p class=sub><b>Action: </b>Providing first aid, treating a wound, or treating poison is a standard action. Treating a disease or tending a creature wounded by a spike growth or spike stones spell takes 10 minutes of work. Treating deadly wounds takes 1 hour of work. Providing long-term care requires 8 hours of light activity. <p class=sub><b>Try Again: </b>Varies. Generally speaking, you can&apos;t try a Heal check again without witnessing proof of the original check&apos;s failure. You can always retry a check to provide first aid, assuming the target of the previous attempt is still alive. <p class=sub><b>Special: </b>A character with the Self-Sufficient feat gets a bonus on Heal checks (see Chapter 5). A healer&apos;s kit gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Heal checks."

The DC of this check is equal to 10 + the target&apos;s Hit Dice + the target&apos;s Wisdom modif ier. If successful, the target gives you the information you desire, takes actions that do not endanger it, or otherwise offers limited assistance. After the Intimidate expires, the target treats you as unfriendly and may report you to local authorities. If you fail this check by 5 or more, the target attempts to deceive you or otherwise hinder your activities. <p class=sub><i>Demoralize: </i>You can use this skill to cause your opponents to become shaken for a number of rounds. The DC of this check is equal to 10 + the target&apos;s Hit Dice + the target&apos;s Wisdom modifier. If you are successful, the target is shaken for 1 round. This duration increases by 1 round for every 5 by which you beat the DC. You can only threaten opponents in this way if they are within 30 feet and can clearly see and hear you. <p class=sub><b>Action: </b>Using Intimidate to change an opponent&apos;s attitude requires 1 minute of conversation. Demoralizing an opponent is a standard action. <p class=sub><b>Try Again: </b>You can attempt to Intimidate an opponent again, but each additional check increases the DC by +5.

In general, the DC of such a check equals 10 + the monster&apos;s CR. For common monsters, such as goblins, the DC of this check equals 5 + the monster&apos;s CR. For particularly rare monsters, such as the tarrasque, the DC of this check equals 15 + the monster&apos;s CR, or more. A successful check allows you to remember a bit of useful information about that monster. For every 5 points by which your check result exceeds the DC, you recall another piece of useful information. Many of the Knowledge skills have specif ic uses as noted on Table 4-6. <p class=sub><b>Action: </b>Usually none. In most cases, a Knowledge check doesn&apos;t take an action (but see &quot;Untrained,&quot; below). <p class=sub><b>Try Again: </b>No. The check represents what you know, and thinking about a topic a second time doesn&apos;t let you know something that you never learned in the first place. <p class=sub><b>Untrained: </b>You cannot make an untrained Knowledge check with a DC higher than 10.

The DCs for various tasks involving Use Magic Device checks are summarized on the table below.<table class=pftable><tr><th class=pftable>Task</th><th class=pftable>Use Magic Device DC</th></tr> <tr><td class=pftable>Activate blindly</td><td class='pftable number'>25</td></tr> <tr><td class=pftable>Decipher a written spell</td><td class='pftable number'>25 + spell level</td></tr> <tr><td class=pftable>Use a scroll</td><td class='pftable number'>20 + caster level</td></tr> <tr><td class=pftable>Use a wand</td><td class='pftable number'>20</td></tr> <tr><td class=pftable>Emulate a class feature</td><td class='pftable number'>20</td></tr> <tr><td class=pftable>Emulate an ability score</td><td class='pftable number'>See text</td></tr> <tr><td class=pftable>Emulate a race</td><td class='pftable number'>25</td></tr> <tr><td class=pftable>Emulate an alignment</td><td class='pftable number'>30</td></tr></table><p class=sub><i>Activate Blindly</i>: Some magic items are activated by special words, thoughts, or actions. You can activate such an item as if you were using the activation word, thought, or action, even when you&#39;re not and even if you don&#39;t know it. You do have to perform some equivalent activity in order to make the check. That is, you must speak, wave the item around, or otherwise attempt to get it to activate. You get a +2 bonus on your Use Magic Device check if you&#39;ve activated the item in question at least once before. If you fail by 9 or less, you can&#39;t activate the device. If you fail by 10 or more, you suffer a mishap. A mishap means that magical energy gets released but doesn&#39;t do what you wanted it to do. The default mishaps are that the item affects the wrong target or that uncontrolled magical energy is released, dealing 2d6 points of damage to you. This mishap is in addition to the chance for a mishap that you normally risk when you cast a spell from a scroll that you could not otherwise cast yourself.<p class=sub><i>Decipher a Written Spell</i>: This usage works just like deciphering a written spell with the Spellcraft skill, except that the DC is 5 points higher. Deciphering a written spell requires 1 minute of concentration.<p class=sub><i>Emulate an Ability Score</i>: To cast a spell from a scroll, you need a high score in the appropriate ability (Intelligence for wizard spells, Wisdom for divine spells, or Charisma for sorcerer or bard spells). Your effective ability score (appropriate to the class you&#39;re emulating when you try to cast the spell from the scroll) is your Use Magic Device check result minus 15. If you already have a high enough score in the appropriate ability, you don&#39;t need to make this check.<p class=sub><i>Emulate an Alignment</i>: Some magic items have positive or negative effects based on the user&#39;s alignment. Use Magic Device lets you use these items as if you were of an alignment of your choice. You can emulate only one alignment at a time.<p class=sub><i>Emulate a Class Feature</i>: Sometimes you need to use a class feature to activate a magic item. In this case, your effective level in the emulated class equals your Use Magic Device check result minus 20. This skill does not let you actually use the class feature of another class. It just lets you activate items as if you had that class feature. If the class whose feature you are emulating has an alignment requirement, you must meet it, either honestly or by emulating an appropriate alignment with a separate Use Magic Device check (see above).<p class=sub><i>Emulate a Race</i>: Some magic items work only for members of certain races, or work better for members of those races. You can use such an item as if you were a member of a race of your choice. You can emulate only one race at a time.<p class=sub><i>Use a Scroll</i>: Normally, to cast a spell from a scroll, you must have the scroll&#39;s spell on your class spell list. Use Magic Device allows you to use a scroll as if you had a particular spell on your class spell list. The DC is equal to 20 + the caster level of the spell you are trying to cast from the scroll. In addition, casting a spell from a scroll requires a minimum score (10 + spell level) in the appropriate ability. If you don&#39;t have a sufficient score in that ability, you must emulate the ability score with a separate Use Magic Device check.<p class=sub>This use of the skill also applies to other spell completion magic items.<p class=sub><i>Use a Wand, Staff, or Other Spell Trigger Item</i>: Normally, to use a wand, you must have the wand&#39;s spell on your class spell list. This use of the skill allows you to use a wand as if you had a particular spell on your class spell list.<p class=sub><b>Action</b>: None. The Use Magic Device check is made as part of the action (if any) required to activate the magic item.<p class=sub><b>Try Again</b>: Yes, but if you ever roll a natural 1 while attempting to activate an item and you fail, then you can&#39;t try to activate that item again for 24 hours. Special: You cannot take 10 with this skill. You can&#39;t aid another on Use Magic Device checks. Only the user of the item may attempt such a check.<p class=sub>If you have the Magical Aptitude feat, you gain a bonus on Use Magic Device checks (see Chapter 5)."
